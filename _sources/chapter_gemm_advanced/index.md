# Scaling GEMM with Warp Specialization and Clusters

:::{admonition} Overview
:class: overview

- The pipelined GEMM still has one warpgroup doing load, MMA, and writeback in sequence, the bottleneck this chapter removes.
- Step 7 specializes warps into roles, Step 8 adds a 2-CTA cluster, Step 9 adds multiple consumers.
- Each step removes a serial bottleneck, ending near state-of-the-art throughput.
:::

The pipelined GEMM from the previous chapter ({ref}`chap_gemm_async`) is fast, yet it still asks one warpgroup to do everything: issue the load, run the MMA, then write the result back, in that order. That single team of threads is a bottleneck even when its work overlaps across loop iterations, because the chip's three engines funnel through it: the TMA unit goes quiet while the Tensor Cores run, the Tensor Cores go quiet while the result drains to memory, and each engine ends up waiting on the others through one set of threads. The way past this is to stop making one team do everything. Split the roles so a dedicated warp loads while another computes and a third writes back, then bring more of the GPU to bear on each tile. We pursue this in three steps of widening cooperation: Step 7 ({ref}`chap_warp_specialization`) specializes warps into producer, consumer, and writeback roles; Step 8 ({ref}`chap_cta_cluster`) joins two CTAs into a cluster that share operands across their shared memory; and Step 9 ({ref}`chap_multi_consumer`) adds a second MMA consumer so one staged tile feeds twice the math. Each step removes a serial bottleneck, and together they carry the kernel to near state-of-the-art throughput.

It helps to see the three steps as one idea applied at widening scales. In Step 7 the cooperation stays inside a single warpgroup: we split it into specialized roles (a warp that issues TMA loads, the *producer*; a warp that runs the MMA, the *consumer*; and a warpgroup that handles writeback) so that loading and computing now overlap instead of taking turns. In Step 8 the cooperation reaches across CTAs: two of them join as a cluster, and a single `tcgen05` MMA produces a 256×256 tile spanning both, so one load of B feeds twice as much MMA work. In Step 9 we push the density further still by adding a second MMA consumer; the cluster output grows to 512×256, each staged B tile is reused by both consumers, and we arrive at the densest variant in the tutorial.

One thing stays constant through all of this. The SMEM, TMEM, and register layouts still honor the contracts we built in the previous two chapters; what we are changing is *who cooperates*, not how data is laid out. Step 8 is the first time the cooperating scope widens past a single CTA, and that is worth flagging: its operand tiles are split across the two CTAs' shared memory, and one layout now spans both CTAs along the `cbx` cluster axis we introduce there.

## Step 7: Warp Specialization + Pipeline

The single-warpgroup kernel leaves performance on the table for a simple reason: every thread walks the same path, load, then compute, then write, and so while it is loading, the Tensor Cores have nothing to do, and while it is computing, the TMA engine has nothing to do. The fix is *warp specialization*. Instead of asking one team of threads to do every job in turn, we hand each job to a dedicated warp and let those warps run at the same time, stitched together by a software pipeline. This is the biggest architectural change in the GEMM path, and the rest of the chapter builds on top of it. The benchmarks here use M=N=K=4096.

> **What this step changes: Scope**
> - Scope: one warpgroup walking load → MMA → writeback in order becomes three concurrent roles (TMA producer, MMA consumer, writeback) connected by full/empty barriers.
> - Layout: unchanged, same SMEM stages and TMEM accumulator as Step 6.
> - Dispatch: unchanged, TMA loads, `tcgen05` MMA.

**Topics.**

- Warp specialization: dedicating different warps/warpgroups to different tasks

- High-level barrier abstractions: `TMABar`, `TCGen05Bar`, `MBarrier`

- `PipelineState` for automatic stage/phase management

- `warpgroup_sync` barrier IDs for per-warpgroup synchronization

(The multi-stage SMEM pipeline and the persistent `ClusterPersistentScheduler2D` are reused unchanged from Steps 5–6; only the scope split is new here.)

### From Sequential to Concurrent

Before introducing the roles and barriers, it helps to isolate the scheduling bottleneck that warp specialization removes. The figure below uses a Step-4-style sequential timeline as a compact reference for the pre-specialization kernels in Steps 4-6, then puts it above the Step 7 warp-specialized schedule so the difference in engine utilization is visible at a glance.

![Warp Specialization Timeline](../img/warp_specialization_timeline.png)

The figure is a before-and-after contrast, and it is worth reading slowly. On top is the pre-specialization single-warpgroup pattern: the same unspecialized thread group owns both the load path and the MMA path, so one engine can easily go idle while the other is active. Steps 5 and 6 improve that baseline with double buffering and persistent scheduling, but they do not yet split loading and compute into independent producer and consumer roles. On the bottom, specialization breaks that turn-taking. The TMA producer prefetches the next tile while the MMA consumer is busy computing, and writeback proceeds on its own. Producer warp 3 issues the next load while consumer warp 0 is still grinding through the current MMA, so neither engine has to wait on the other. Of course, overlap is not free; its price is coordination. The warps now have to tell each other when data is ready and when a buffer has been freed up, and two barriers carry those messages:

- **`tma2mma`** (TMA → MMA): signals that the loaded SMEM data is ready for MMA to consume.
- **`mma2tma`** (MMA → TMA): signals that MMA has finished reading a buffer, so TMA can reuse it for the next load.

One detail in the figure can look like a mistake at first: the `mma2tma` arrows skip ahead by a stage. The reason is the ring buffer. With `PIPE_DEPTH=2` there are two SMEM buffers, stage 0 and stage 1; TMA Load k=0 fills buffer 0, and TMA Load k=1 fills buffer 1. When MMA Compute k=0 finishes reading buffer 0, it signals `mma2tma` to say the buffer is free, but the load that actually wants buffer 0 back is TMA Load k=2, not k=1 (which is using buffer 1). That is why the `mma2tma` arrow from MMA Compute k=0 reaches all the way to TMA Load k=2. The release jumps a stage simply because the ring has two slots.

### Warp Roles

The timeline showed *why* we split the work; the next question is *who* does each part. Specialization assigns the three jobs (load, compute, writeback) to specific warps so they can run at once. With `WG_NUMBER=2`, the kernel uses two warpgroups (abbreviated WG in the role table):

| Actor | Location | Job |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **TMA Producer** | Warpgroup 1, warp 3 | Continuously loads A and B tiles via TMA |
| **MMA Consumer** | Warpgroup 1, warp 0 | Runs MMA as soon as data is ready |
| **Writeback** | Warpgroup 0 (all warps) | Reads TMEM results, writes to GMEM |

### 4 Barriers

Three concurrent actors need four barriers, and the four sort neatly into two opposite directions. The forward path (TMA → MMA → Writeback) signals data *readiness*; its message is "the tile you were waiting for is here." The backward path (Writeback → MMA → TMA) signals buffer *release*: "the slot you wanted is free again." Once you know the naming convention the names read themselves: each is `source2destination`, so `tma2mma` is simply the barrier on which TMA signals MMA.

| Barrier | Type | Direction | Meaning |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| **tma2mma** | `TMABar` | TMA -> MMA | "SMEM data is ready" |
| **mma2tma** | `TCGen05Bar` | MMA -> TMA | "SMEM buffer can be reused" |
| **mma2ld** | `TCGen05Bar` | MMA -> Writeback | "TMEM results are ready" |
| **ld2mma** | `MBarrier` | Writeback -> MMA | "TMEM is free for next tile" |

Why does each barrier have the *type* it does? The type follows from how the producer announces that it is done. **TMA Loads** use `TMABar`, an mbarrier with byte counting: the TMA hardware itself arrives on the barrier once the transfer's bytes have landed, so the consumer learns the data is ready without any thread having to poll. **TMA Stores** cannot use this (a store has nobody to notify), so they fall back to `cp_async.bulk.commit_group()` + `wait_group(0)`, where the issuing thread simply waits for its own write to drain. **MMA operations** use `TCGen05Bar`, on which the `tcgen05.commit()` instruction signals the barrier when the MMA finishes.

One small detail here will pay off in Step 8. The `arrive` calls pass `cta_mask=0`, because in a single-CTA kernel there is no other CTA to signal. When Step 8 forms a cluster, this very argument turns nonzero and becomes the mechanism for waking the cooperating CTAs.

### PipelineState

The four barriers tell the roles *when* a buffer is ready; something still has to track *which* buffer each role is on as the pipeline cycles. That bookkeeping is what `PipelineState` manages. A ring buffer carries two pieces of bookkeeping at once: which slot we are currently on, and which "phase" of that slot's barrier we are waiting for. Tracking both by hand across a pipelined loop is exactly the kind of thing that breeds off-by-one errors, and an off-by-one here deadlocks the whole kernel. `PipelineState` exists to keep the two together so you do not have to:

```python
tma_ps = PipelineState(PIPE_DEPTH, phase=1)   # Producer starts ready (phase=1)
# tma_ps.stage = current stage index
# tma_ps.phase = current phase (0 or 1)
tma_ps.advance()                          # Advance to next stage
```

The initial `phase` is what decides whether a role's very first `wait` lets it run or makes it block, and the right answer is opposite at the two ends of the pipe, which is the part that trips people up:
- `phase=1` (producer) -> the first `wait(phase=1)` sees the barrier still at phase 0, and since 0 != 1 it **passes immediately**. That is exactly what we want, because the buffers start empty and the producer should be free to start filling them right away.

- `phase=0` (consumer) -> the first `wait(phase=0)` sees the barrier at phase 0, and since 0 == 0 it **blocks**. Again what we want, because there is no data yet and the consumer has nothing to read until the producer arrives.

Give both ends the same starting phase and you get a deadlock or, worse, silent corruption, so this one choice is worth getting right.

### `warpgroup_sync` Barrier IDs

Specialization introduces a synchronization hazard that is easy to walk into. Once each warpgroup runs a different code path, the familiar `cta_sync()` will deadlock: it uses hardware barrier #0 and insists that *every* CTA thread arrive, yet inside a warpgroup branch only some of those threads are present. What we need instead is a barrier scoped to a single warpgroup. The GPU gives us 16 named barriers (IDs 0–15), so the kernels reach for `warpgroup_sync(10)`, which synchronizes only the threads within one warpgroup. When several warpgroups each need to sync on their own, as happens in the multi-consumer Step 9, they take distinct IDs via `warpgroup_sync(wg_id + 10)` so that they never collide on the same hardware barrier.

**Implementation.**

We use `PIPE_DEPTH=2` here, the smallest depth that still lets load and compute overlap at all. Going deeper hides more memory latency, up to the limit of the SMEM budget; the *When Step 7 misbehaves* discussion below works through that trade-off in detail. With all the pieces now in hand (the roles, the four barriers, `PipelineState`, and warpgroup-scoped sync), we can put together the full kernel:

To run any of these kernels, reuse the same compile / run / check harness we showed once in Step 1 ({ref}`chap_gemm_basics`): swap `hgemm_v1` for `hgemm_v7`, `hgemm_v8`, or `hgemm_v9`, and pick a problem size such as `M=N=K=4096`. Keep in mind that the clustered steps need `M` and `N` to be multiples of their cluster tile (`256×256` for Step 8, `512×256` for Step 9), so a tiny `128×128` size produces no tiles at all. Compile one step per fresh Python session, restarting the kernel before you switch steps, because the kernels reuse inner names and the compiler holds per-session state. The per-step timings are collected in *End-to-End Result* below.

### Epilogue (Writeback) Details

Step 7 can afford a pleasantly simple epilogue. With only `BLK_N=128` columns, the writeback warpgroup reads the whole TMEM tile into registers in a single pass and then issues one TMA store. Steps 8 and 9 will not have this luxury, which is precisely why they introduce the chunking we add later, but for now the sequence is:

1. Wait for MMA: `mma2ld.wait(phase)`. Steps 8 and 9 in this tutorial add a `fence.after_thread_sync()` here as a conservative extra; the MMA-completion mbarrier already covers the ordering, and most kernels (including CUTLASS) omit it, so Step 7 does too.
2. Read TMEM -> registers (128 fp32 per thread, warpgroup scope via `Tx.copy_async(reg_wg, tmem[:, :BLK_N])` followed by `T.ptx.tcgen05.wait.ld()`).
3. Signal MMA: `ld2mma.arrive(0, cta_id=0, pred=True)` (all 128 threads arrive); TMEM is now free for the next tile. The two `arrive` kwargs recur in the clustered steps: `cta_id` names *which CTA's* copy of the barrier to signal (`0` = this CTA, the local barrier; in Step 8 the cooperative arrives target CTA-0 via `cta_mask` instead), and `pred` is a per-thread predicate gating whether this thread actually arrives (`True` here, so every writeback thread counts toward the arrival total).
4. Cast fp32 -> fp16 in registers.
5. Write registers -> Dsmem, then `fence.proxy_async("shared::cta") + warpgroup_sync(10)` to flush.
6. TMA store Dsmem -> GMEM via `cp_async.bulk.commit_group() + wait_group(0)`.

Step 8 (with `BLK_N=256`) and Step 9 (with `MMA_N=256` per consumer) cannot keep this one-pass form, and the reason is register pressure. Reading 256 fp32 values per thread means 256 × 4 = 1024 bytes have to live in each thread's registers at the same time, which risks spilling out to local memory and, on top of that, forces a larger Dsmem buffer. So those steps break the writeback into `EPI_N`-column chunks (`EPI_N=64`): each iteration keeps only `EPI_N` fp32 registers live and issues a correspondingly smaller TMA store, trading a few more store instructions for a register budget that stays comfortable.

**Implementation notes.**

- **Persistent kernel**: `bx = T.cta_id([SM_COUNT])` --- one CTA per SM, loops over tiles

- **L2-friendly scheduling**: `ClusterPersistentScheduler2D` orders tiles for cache locality

- This pattern --- warp specialization plus software pipelining --- is common in high-performance GEMM kernels, including CUTLASS-style designs.

### When Step 7 Misbehaves

The same concurrency that makes Step 7 fast also makes it the first GEMM kernel that is genuinely easy to break. With TMA, MMA, and writeback all in flight at once, a single misplaced barrier can deadlock the kernel, crash the CUDA context, or quietly corrupt the output. These same failure modes come back in Steps 8 and 9, so rather than repeat them three times, we have gathered the whole debugging playbook into *Debugging Warp-Specialized Kernels* at the end of this chapter; turn to it whenever something goes wrong.

**Pipeline depth tuning.** The Step 7 kernel runs at `PIPE_DEPTH=2`, the minimum. Pushing it to 4 or 6 lets the TMA producer race further ahead of the MMA consumer and hide more memory latency, but it does so by spending more SMEM, and SMEM is finite. The B200 offers 228 KB per SM (see *Numbers to Keep in Mind* in {ref}`chap_background`). With `BLK_M=BLK_N=128, BLK_K=64, fp16`, each pipeline stage costs `(128*64 + 128*64) * 2 = 32 KB` for A and B together, and the `Dsmem` writeback staging buffer adds another 32 KB on top. That puts `PIPE_DEPTH=4` at roughly 160 KB and `PIPE_DEPTH=6` at roughly 224 KB, right up against the budget. To go any deeper than that, you would have to rethink the writeback staging strategy.

---

Warp specialization got the threads of one CTA cooperating. The next step widens that cooperation across the boundary of the CTA itself, putting two of them to work on a single larger tile.


(chap_cta_cluster)=
## Step 8: 2-CTA Cluster

Step 7 got the engines overlapping, but each CTA was still off computing its own 128×128 tile in isolation, reloading operands that no neighbor could borrow. Step 8 breaks that isolation. Two CTAs join into a cluster and gain the ability to reach into each other's shared memory, so a single cooperative `tcgen05` MMA produces one 256×256 tile that spans both of them, and one load of B now feeds twice as much MMA work. As before, M=N=K=4096.

> **What this step changes: Scope + Layout + Dispatch**
> - Scope: the cooperating scope now spans two CTAs in a cluster, not one.
> - Layout: operand tiles are split across the two CTAs' SMEM; CTA 0 owns the shared completion barrier (`remote_view`).
> - Dispatch: the MMA gains `cta_group` / `cta_mask` so `tcgen05` runs as a 2-CTA cooperative op.

**Topics.**

- CTA clusters: multiple CTAs cooperating on a larger tile

- Cross-CTA SMEM access via `map_shared_rank`

- `cta_group=2` for cooperative MMA over a 256x256 cluster tile

- Cross-CTA barrier signaling with `cta_mask`


### Cluster Tile Shape

The whole optimization rests on a single hardware capability: with `cta_group=2`, the MMA is allowed to read operand tiles staged by *both* CTAs, not just the one it lives on. Each CTA loads one 128-row slice of stored B, which, after the transpose, becomes 128 logical output columns, and the cooperative MMA stitches the two slices back together into one operand. The figure below traces how the two CTAs' A and B slices combine into the single 256×256 cluster tile:

```{raw} html
<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
<iframe src="../demo/cta_cluster.html" title="A 2-CTA cluster: cooperative MMA via cross-CTA SMEM read" loading="lazy"
        style="width:100%; min-width:720px; height:580px; border:1px solid var(--pst-color-border, #d0d0d0); border-radius:6px;"></iframe>
</div>
```
*Interactive: each CTA owns half of A and half of B, reads the other's B across the cluster (DSMEM),
and the pair produces one 256×256 output tile.*

**Why A and B are split across the cluster**: To see how the 256×256 tile gets partitioned, recall that the tutorial stores GEMM as `D = A @ B.T`, where stored B has shape `N x K`. With two CTAs in a cluster, the split falls out cleanly:

- **A is split vertically**: CTA-0 holds A0 (rows 0-127), CTA-1 holds A1 (rows 128-255). Stacked: `[A0; A1]` (256 rows).
- **Stored B is split by rows**: CTA-0 loads B rows 0-127, CTA-1 loads B rows 128-255. Because the math uses `B.T`, those two stored row slices become two 128-column slices of the logical right-hand operand.
- With `cta_group=2`, the MMA hardware reads B from **both** CTAs' SMEM via cross-CTA shared memory access, so it sees the full logical output-column span.
- Result: the two CTAs cooperate on one 256x256 output tile. Each CTA writes a 128x256 row stripe of that tile.

It is worth pausing to see why this is a real win and not just a reshuffle of work. Each CTA still loads only 128×K of A and 128×K of B, so the cluster as a whole stages about 2× a single CTA's operands, and yet it produces a 256×256 tile, which carries about 4× the output FLOPs of a 128×128 tile. The MMA therefore does roughly twice the work per staged-operand byte, because each CTA's B slice is reused against the other CTA's A slice through the cooperative MMA. In other words, arithmetic intensity roughly doubles, and that is exactly the lever a still memory-leaning kernel needs: the ~2.2× speedup in the End-to-End table comes from feeding the same bytes to more math.

### Tile Address Calculation

Now that the cluster is the unit of work, the tile scheduler has to count in cluster tiles too. Each `(m_idx, n_idx)` it hands back names a full 256×256 region, and the two CTAs inside the cluster split that region between them. Translating a cluster coordinate into the per-CTA slice that each one actually loads looks like this:

```python
m_st = (m_idx * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_M
n_st = (n_idx * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_N
```

Both CTAs work on the *same* 256×256 cluster tile, and the single coordinate `cbx` (the CTA's position within the cluster, either 0 or 1) is what picks out this CTA's contribution along both axes. `m_st` selects the output row stripe this CTA owns, `n_st` selects the stored-B slice it feeds into the cooperative MMA, and the writeback later emits both 128-column halves of the 256-column output span. Note as well that `num_m_tiles = M // 256` and `num_n_tiles = N // 256` count cluster tiles, not individual CTA tiles.

At a glance `cbx` appears in both `m_st` and `n_st`, as though a row offset had somehow leaked into the column, but both uses are correct, and it is worth untangling why. On the writeback path, `cbx` belongs to the M axis alone: each CTA owns a distinct 128-row stripe (`m_st = (m_idx * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_M`, so CTA-0 writes rows `m_idx*256 .. +128` and CTA-1 the next 128), and yet both CTAs write the *full* 256 output columns of the cluster tile. That is exactly why the store derives its column from the cluster's `n_idx` (`n_st_epi = n_idx * 256 + no * 128`, with no `cbx` in sight) rather than from the per-CTA `n_st`. The reason `n_st` carries `cbx` at all is that each CTA loads a different stored-B row slice into the MMA: there, `cbx` is a *load* offset, not the CTA's output-column offset.

### Code Changes from Step 7

For all the conceptual weight behind it, the actual diff against Step 7 is only six edits, each one encoding a single piece of the cluster contract we just described:

```python
# 1. Cluster launch
cbx, cby = T.cta_id_in_cluster([CTA_GROUP, 1])   # cbx = CTA index within cluster (0 or 1)

# 2. Cooperative MMA (was cta_group=1)
Tx.gemm_async(..., cta_group=2)

# 3. Cross-CTA shared memory access
B_remote = T.ptx.map_shared_rank(Bsmem, cta_id=1)

# 4. Cross-CTA barrier
tma2mma_cta0 = T.decl_buffer(
    [CTA_GROUP], "uint64",
    data=T.ptx.map_shared_rank(tma2mma.ptr_to([0]), 0),
    scope="shared"
)

# 5. mma2tma / mma2ld arrives go from cta_mask=0 (single CTA, Step 7)
#    to cta_mask=3 (signal both CTAs in the cluster)
mma2tma.arrive(mma_ps.stage, cta_group=CTA_GROUP, cta_mask=3)
mma2ld.arrive(0, cta_group=CTA_GROUP, cta_mask=3)

# 6. Cluster sync replaces cta_sync at the end
T.cuda.cluster_sync()
```


### Cluster-Scope Changes

Those six edits all stem from the same shift: the cooperating scope is now the cluster rather than a single CTA. The points below spell out what that widening means in practice: how each CTA finds its place, whose barriers the cluster coordinates on, and which CTA actually issues the cooperative MMA.

- **Cluster CTA ID**: `cbx` tells each CTA its position in the cluster (0 or 1). CTA-0 handles A rows 0-127, CTA-1 handles rows 128-255.

- **Remote barrier view**: In a cluster, each CTA has its own SMEM and its own barriers, which raises an obvious question: if CTA-1 needs to wait on something CTA-0 produces, whose barrier does it actually touch? The answer is to nominate CTA-0's barriers as the single coordination point and let any CTA in the cluster reach them. `map_shared_rank(tma2mma.ptr_to([0]), 0)` returns a cluster-wide pointer to CTA-0's barrier, with the TIRx wrapper `tma2mma.remote_view(0)`, and from then on every arrive and wait targets CTA-0's copy.

- **MMA dispatch from CTA-0 only**: It is tempting to read `cta_group=2` as firing two engines in parallel, but that is not what happens. CTA-0 issues exactly one `tcgen05.mma`, and the hardware then drives a *single cooperative* MMA that spans both CTAs, reading operands from both SMs' SMEM and writing the accumulator across both SMs' TMEM. CTA-1 issues no MMA at all. (Each SM has only one `tcgen05` engine, so `cta_group=2` is one cross-SM MMA, not two engines running side by side.) This is why the code guards the MMA with `if cbx == 0:`.

- **Multicast arrive**: `tcgen05.commit(..., cta_group=2, cta_mask=3)` is issued only by CTA-0 but signals both CTAs' barriers. `cta_mask=3` (binary `11`) means both CTA-0 and CTA-1 are targeted.

- **ld2mma init count**: `init(128 * CTA_GROUP)` --- both CTAs' writeback warpgroups (128 threads each) arrive.

**What changes for 2 CTAs.**

- `CTA_GROUP = 2`, `MMA_N = BLK_N * CTA_GROUP = 256`

- `ld2mma.init(128 * CTA_GROUP)` --- both CTAs' writeback WGs arrive

- TMA arrive byte count includes both CTAs: `CTA_GROUP * (BLK_M * BLK_K + BLK_N * BLK_K) * F16_SIZE`

- `tcgen05.alloc` and `tcgen05.dealloc` must use `cta_group=2`

- Writeback splits the 256 output columns into two 128-column chunks --- reading all 256 TMEM columns at once exceeds register capacity. Step 9 shrinks the chunk further to `EPI_N=64`

- `cluster_sync()` replaces `cta_sync()` at the end (ensures all CTAs are done before TMEM dealloc)

All that extra arithmetic intensity shows up directly on the wall clock: Step 8 reaches **0.104 ms** at 4096³, about 676× over the 70 ms Step-1 algorithm at the same size (see the End-to-End table). The kernel is now leaning toward compute-bound, and that is precisely what sets up Step 9, where we add a second MMA consumer to keep even more Tensor Core work in flight.

If Step 8 comes out *slower* than Step 7, the culprit is almost always one of the new cluster contracts entered slightly wrong. Three things are worth checking first: that the TMA arrive byte count is `CTA_GROUP * (BLK_M*BLK_K + BLK_N*BLK_K) * F16_SIZE`; that the scheduler dimensions are `num_m_tiles=M//256, num_n_tiles=N//256` for the 256×256 cluster tile; and that writeback issues two TMA stores, one per 128-column chunk, each of which drains before Dsmem is reused.

---

Clusters raised reuse *across* CTAs. The final step turns inward and raises compute density *within* each CTA, by giving the producer a second MMA consumer to keep fed.


(chap_multi_consumer)=
## Step 9: Multi-Consumer Warp Specialization

By Step 8 the MMA is genuinely busy, but a single consumer warp can only chew through a staged B tile so fast, and that B tile is just sitting there in SMEM the whole time, available to anyone who cares to read it. The final optimization takes advantage of that: it adds a second MMA consumer that multiplies a *different* A block against the *same* B tile. The compute density per CTA doubles, and the cluster output grows from 256×256 to 512×256. As before, M=N=K=4096.

> **What this step changes: Scope + Layout**
> - Scope: one MMA consumer becomes two, selected by `warp_id`.
> - Layout: one staged B tile is reused by both consumers; A gains a consumer axis.
> - Dispatch: unchanged.

**Topics.**

- Multiple MMA warps (consumers) for higher throughput

- Multiple writeback warpgroups with independent barrier slots

- The structure used by the most optimized GEMM variant in this tutorial


### Multi-Consumer Structure

Adding a second consumer means the kernel now has more distinct roles to lay out: two MMA warps instead of one, and a matching second writeback warpgroup to drain the extra accumulator. With `NUM_CONSUMER=2` and `WG_NUMBER=3`, the kernel now spans three warpgroups (abbreviated WG in the role table):

| Warpgroup | Warp | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| **WG 2** | warp 0 | MMA consumer 0: `Asmem[..., 0] x B` -> TMEM cols `[0:256]` |
| **WG 2** | warp 1 | MMA consumer 1: `Asmem[..., 1] x B` -> TMEM cols `[256:512]` |
| **WG 2** | warp 3 | TMA producer: loads 2x A blocks + 1x B block per stage |
| **WG 0** | all | Writeback for consumer 0: reads TMEM `[0:256]` |
| **WG 1** | all | Writeback for consumer 1: reads TMEM `[256:512]` |

The whole arrangement hinges on one asymmetry. Each consumer multiplies its own A block against the *same* staged B tile, so a single B load now feeds 2× the MMA work, and B's load cost per useful FLOP is effectively halved. The reason we share B and not A is that the two consumers cover different M-row stripes: their A blocks are genuinely different data, while B is identical for both. Exercise 3 asks you to convince yourself this is the only sharing that works.

### Changes from Step 8

Concretely, supporting the second consumer touches the kernel in a handful of places, and every change traces back to one fact: there are now two A blocks and two TMEM ranges to feed and drain per stage, while B stays shared. The edits below stage an extra A block, give each consumer its own barrier slot, and adjust the tile addressing for the taller 512×256 cluster tile.

- `Asmem = pool.alloc((PIPE_DEPTH, NUM_CONSUMER, BLK_M, BLK_K), ...)` --- 2 A blocks per stage, one per consumer

- TMA loads both `Asmem[stage, 0]` and `Asmem[stage, 1]`, with TMA arrive bytes now `CTA_GROUP * (NUM_CONSUMER * BLK_M * BLK_K + BLK_N * BLK_K) * F16_SIZE` (extra A block)

- MMA warp `warp_id` selects which A block and TMEM range

- `mma2tma.init(NUM_CONSUMER)` --- both consumers signal TMA per stage

- `mma2ld` and `ld2mma` have `depth=NUM_CONSUMER` --- each consumer uses its own barrier slot (`warp_id` for MMA side, `wg_id` for writeback side)

- Tile address: `m_st = (m_idx * NUM_CONSUMER * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_M` --- M direction has the extra `NUM_CONSUMER` factor because each cluster tile now spans `NUM_CONSUMER` consumers in M. Tile scheduler uses `num_m_tiles = M // 256 // NUM_CONSUMER` (cluster tile is 512x256)

- Writeback uses chunked `EPI_N` so each iteration keeps fewer TMEM-readback values live in registers

**Implementation notes.**

- In this Step 9 design, `mma2ld` and `ld2mma` are each a single shared object with `depth=NUM_CONSUMER`, rather than separate per-consumer objects. Slot 0 connects MMA warp 0 to Warpgroup 0, and slot 1 connects MMA warp 1 to Warpgroup 1; the MMA side indexes by `warp_id`, the writeback side by `wg_id`.

- This is the most heavily optimized GEMM structure we show in the tutorial.

## Debugging Warp-Specialized Kernels

Steps 7, 8, and 9 tend to fail in the same handful of ways, and for the same underlying reason: TMA, MMA, and writeback all run concurrently, so a single wrong barrier can deadlock the kernel, crash the CUDA context, or corrupt the output. The good news is that the failures are stereotyped. Once you learn to recognize the *shape* of a bug, the fix is usually a one-liner. Keep this checklist close, because these bugs come up again and again.

### Inspecting Generated Code

When a warp-specialized kernel misbehaves, the first thing to do is look at what the compiler actually emitted, in particular whether the role guards and barrier inits landed where you expected them to. For any compiled kernel:

```python
cuda_source = ex.mod.imports[0].inspect_source("cuda")
print(cuda_source)
```

The generated code maps TIRx constructs to CUDA like this:

| TIRx | Generated CUDA |
|------|---------------|
| `wg_id == 0` | `(warp_id_in_cta >> 2) == 0` |
| `wg_id == 1` | `(warp_id_in_cta >> 2) == 1` |
| `warp_id == 0` | `(warp_id_in_cta & 3) == 0` |
| `warp_id == 3` | `(warp_id_in_cta & 3) == 3` |
| `lane_id == 0` | `(((int)threadIdx.x) % 32) == 0` |
| `.init()` internal guard | `((int)threadIdx.x) < 1` (CTA thread 0 only) |
| `elect_sync()` | `tvm_builtin_elect_one_sync_op()` |

### Reference: Generated CUDA Skeleton

A correctly compiled Step 7 kernel has the top-level skeleton below. When you are debugging, run `inspect_source()` and check that your output matches this structure:

```c
// (1) Barrier inits: top level, CTA thread 0 only
if (threadIdx.x < 1) {
  mbarrier_init(tma2mma[0..1], 1);
  mbarrier_init(mma2tma[0..1], 1);
  mbarrier_init(mma2ld, 1);
  mbarrier_init(ld2mma, 128);   // arrived by all 128 WG0 threads
}

// (2) TMEM alloc: WG0 warp 0, all 32 lanes (no lane guard)
if (wg_id == 0 && warp_id == 0) tcgen05_alloc(..., 512);

// (3) Fences + cta_sync, then phase init: producer=1, consumer=0

// (4) Warp-specialized loop
if (wg_id == 1 && warp_id == 3 && elect_sync) { /* TMA  */ while(valid){ ... next_tile(); } }
if (wg_id == 1 && warp_id == 0 && elect_sync) { /* MMA  */ while(valid){ ... next_tile(); } }
if (wg_id == 0)                                { /* WB   */ while(valid){ ... next_tile(); } }

// (5) Cleanup: warp 0, no lane guard
cta_sync();
if (warp_id == 0) { tcgen05_relinquish_alloc_permit(); tcgen05_dealloc(..., 512); }
```

Things to verify in your generated code:

- Barrier inits sit at **top level** (not inside a `wg_id` guard); see *Deadlocks*.
- `tcgen05_alloc`/`dealloc` have a **warp guard but no lane guard**; all 32 lanes participate.
- TMA and MMA loops both iterate `K_TILES` times.
- Phase init: producer=`1`, consumer=`0`.

### Symptom Map

Before you reach for any tool, the symptom alone usually narrows the search to one of the sections below:

| Symptom | Failure class | Where to look |
|---|---|---|

### Deadlocks

Almost every deadlock comes down to *one* of the following, so it pays to work through the list in order:

- **Arrival count ≠ init count.** Common case: `MBarrier.init(128)` but `arrive` is guarded by `if warp_id == 0: if lane_id == 0:`, so only 1 thread arrives, the wait never returns. Reference:

  | Barrier | init(count) | Who arrives | Arrivals |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `TMABar` (tma→mma) | 1 | TMA engine via `arrive(stage, bytes)` | 1 |
  | `TCGen05Bar` (mma→tma, mma→ld) | 1 | MMA warp via `tcgen05.commit` | 1 |
  | `MBarrier` (ld→mma) | 128 | All WG0 threads via `arrive` | 128 |

- **Barrier init nested inside a `wg_id` guard.** `.init()` lowers to `if threadIdx.x < 1:` (i.e., thread 0 of the CTA, which lives in WG0). Nest it inside `if wg_id == 1:` and **no** thread satisfies both, so the barrier stays uninitialized. Inits must be at top level; `grep mbarrier_init` in `inspect_source()` to verify.

- **`cta_sync()` inside a warpgroup branch.** `cta_sync` is `__syncthreads()`, which requires *all* CTA threads. Inside `if wg_id == 0:`, WG1 never reaches it. Use `T.cuda.warpgroup_sync(10)` instead.

- **`tile_scheduler.next_tile()` not called by all threads in the consumer warpgroup.** The scheduler tracks per-thread state; threads that skip it loop forever.

- **TMA and MMA disagree on K-tile count.** If MMA does `K_TILES - 1` instead of `K_TILES`, barrier phases drift and the second outer tile deadlocks.

- **`PipelineState` initial phase wrong.** Producer must start at `phase=1` (first wait passes); consumer at `phase=0` (first wait blocks). Same starting phase ⇒ instant deadlock.

### Crashes (XID 43 / Illegal Memory Access)

Where a deadlock hangs, a crash fails fast and loud. These crashes corrupt the CUDA context, and the tell-tale sign is that a *later*, perfectly innocent `torch.randn` fails too. All three causes are allocation- or warp-shape mistakes:

- **`pool.alloc` after `pool.commit()`.** Barrier wrappers call `alloc` internally. Correct order: `tmem_addr → barrier wrappers → move_base_to(1024) → Asmem / Bsmem / Dsmem → commit()`.
- **`tcgen05.alloc` / `dealloc` with a lane guard.** They require all 32 lanes of the warp to participate; `if lane_id == 0:` runs one thread, which is undefined behavior, often observed as an illegal-instruction or context error, a hang, or (worst) silently wrong results.
- **Missing `cta_sync()` before `tcgen05.dealloc`**: TMEM is freed while writeback is still reading.

### Wrong Results

The third failure class is the quietest: the kernel runs to completion but the numbers are wrong. The tell for these lives in the error pattern itself. Mismatch counts that come out as exact multiples of 128 (128, 256, or 384 rows) point to a sync race rather than bad arithmetic: whole warpgroup-sized stripes are wrong because a handoff slipped, not because any single number was computed incorrectly.

- **`tcgen05.commit` outside `elect_sync`**: all 32 threads create commit groups; the 31 empty ones signal the mbarrier immediately. TMA overwrites SMEM before MMA reads it. Output is zeros or garbage.
- **Missing `fence.proxy_async("shared::cta")` before TMA store**: TMA engine doesn't see SMEM writes from threads.
- **Missing `cp_async.bulk.commit_group()` + `wait_group(0)` after TMA store**: next tile reuses Dsmem before the store drains.
- **Persistent kernel, intermittent fails at small sizes (e.g., 1024×1024)**: not GPU flakiness. Larger sizes mask the race with longer K-loops. Re-check phase reset between tiles and the TMA-store commit/wait.
- **`fence.after_thread_sync()` is usually not the cause.** The MMA-completion mbarrier already carries release→acquire semantics. Steps 8 and 9 here add it conservatively on the writeback edge (after `mma2ld.wait`, before the first `tcgen05.ld`), but it is not a general MMA-boundary fix. Do not add it routinely on the TMA→MMA edge; if your output is wrong, check the barrier and store-drain bullets first.


## End-to-End Result

With all nine steps in hand, it is worth lining them up to see where the time actually went. The table below collects every step from the naive baseline through the warp-specialized cluster kernel, alongside the cuBLAS reference, so the cumulative effect of the chapter reads top to bottom in one place. Reference numbers on NVIDIA B200, M=N=K=4096, fp16, locked clocks, 1000-iteration timed benchmark:

| Step | Technique | Time | Speedup |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Sync load + MMA | 70 ms | 1× |
| 2 | K-loop accumulation | --- | Handle K larger than one tile |
| 3 | Spatial tiling | 53.6 ms | ~1.3× |
| 4 | TMA async load | 0.49 ms | ~142× |
| 5 | Software pipeline | --- | Overlap load + compute |
| 6 | Persistent kernel | --- | L2 cache locality |
| 7 | Warp specialization | 0.23 ms | ~309× |
| 8 | 2-CTA cluster | 0.104 ms | ~676× |
| 9 | Multi-consumer | 0.094 ms | ~744× |
| --- | cuBLAS (reference) | 0.094 ms | ~744× |

Every time in this table, the 70 ms Step 1 baseline included, is measured at the same M=N=K=4096 size, which is what makes the speedup chain comparable end to end. It is worth being precise about what that 70 ms actually is, since it is easy to misread. It is *not* the single-tile Step-1 kernel from {ref}`chap_gemm_basics` run at 4096³; that kernel only ever computes one 128×128 tile and only runs at small sizes. The 70 ms is instead a naive full-size baseline that takes the same sequential, single-tile approach and scales it up to the full 4096³ problem. Steps 1–3 are introduced in {ref}`chap_gemm_basics` at small sizes (128×128 and 256³) to keep those first walkthroughs simple; the Step 1 and Step 3 rows here are their full-size benchmark counterparts. The remaining dashes (Steps 2, 5, 6) mark steps shown for structure but not timed on their own.

Read these numbers as a single B200 reference run under controlled conditions, not as a leaderboard entry. The `{.python .input}` benchmark cells embedded in each step are smoke benchmarks: they are good for spotting trends, not for claiming peak performance.

If you stand back from the table, four techniques account for nearly all of the gain:

1. **TMA Async Data Movement**: a hardware copy engine replaces the software copy (~142× from Step 1 → Step 4). It is important to read this 142× correctly: it reflects going from a single 128×128-tile kernel (grid 1×1) all the way to a full tiled-and-parallel kernel with a K-loop, spatial tiling, and many CTAs, *together with* TMA; it is not TMA's contribution in isolation. Isolating TMA would mean comparing two full-size kernels that differ only in the copy mechanism.
2. **Software Pipelining + Warp Specialization**: overlap load and compute by giving each its own dedicated role (~2.2× from Step 4 → Step 7).
3. **CTA Clusters**: a 2-SM cooperative MMA improves B-tile reuse across CTAs (~2.2× from Step 7 → Step 8 in this benchmark).
4. **Multi-Consumer**: two MMA warps for higher compute density (~10% from Step 8 → Step 9).

Plotted at the measured milestones, those same four contributions trace the descent from the synchronous tiled kernel toward the cuBLAS reference. The figure below shows the selected measured points:

![GEMM Optimization Journey](../img/gemm_perf.png)

Across the table, the path runs from the 70 ms baseline down to 0.094 ms, matching the rounded cuBLAS reference in this run.

Notice that the gains shrink as we go down the list, and there is a structural reason for it rather than any weakening of effort. The early steps go after *memory* bottlenecks (TMA replaces software copies, clusters raise arithmetic intensity), and that is where most of the 70 ms was actually being spent, so those steps pay off the most. By Step 8 the kernel is already within ~10% of cuBLAS (0.104 vs 0.094 ms) and is close to *compute-bound*, which means there is very little memory stall left to hide; Step 9's multi-consumer overlap recovers most of what little remains. A roughly 10% final gain is exactly what to expect near the compute ceiling: it is the diminishing return of a problem that is nearly solved, not the sign of a weak optimization.

Everything we built in this chapter (TMA loads, the `tcgen05` MMA, TMEM readback, and warp-specialized barriers) carries straight over into the next one. Flash Attention reuses all of it, and then raises the difficulty by wedging an online-softmax step between two MMA phases rather than simply repeating a single one.


## Exercises

1. What happens if you set the initial `phase` to `0` for both the TMA and MMA `PipelineState` in Step 7? Draw the deadlock scenario.
2. With `cta_group=2` in Step 8, the TMA arrive byte count is `CTA_GROUP * (BLK_M*BLK_K + BLK_N*BLK_K) * F16_SIZE`. Why multiply by `CTA_GROUP` when each CTA loads its own data?
3. In Step 9, each consumer handles different M rows but the same B tile. Why is sharing B (not A) the right choice?

**Try with your agent**: Paste the Step 7 kernel and ask it to trace one K-tile through the four barriers (`tma2mma`, `mma2tma`, `mma2ld`, `ld2mma`). For each, ask who waits, who arrives, what tile becomes safe to read, and which buffer becomes reusable afterward.

# Scaling GEMM with Warp Specialization and Clusters

The previous chapter ({ref}`chap_gemm_async`) ended with a persistent, software-pipelined GEMM in which a single warpgroup still did load, MMA, and writeback in sequence. This chapter scales that kernel in three steps, each lifting one limit.

Step 7 splits the single warpgroup into specialized roles — a TMA producer, an MMA consumer, and a writeback warpgroup — so loading and computing run at the same time instead of taking turns. Step 8 makes two CTAs cooperate as a cluster, so one `tcgen05` MMA produces a 256×256 tile across both CTAs and a single B load feeds twice the MMA work. Step 9 adds a second MMA consumer, growing the cluster output to 512×256 so each staged B tile is reused by both consumers — the densest variant in the tutorial.

The SMEM, TMEM, and register layouts still follow the contracts from the previous two chapters; the new focus is *who cooperates*. Step 8 is the first time that scope widens past a single CTA: its operand tiles are split across the two CTAs' shared memory, and one layout spans both CTAs along the `cbx` / `cby` cluster axes introduced in that step.

## Step 7: Warp Specialization + Pipeline

Step 7 is the biggest architectural change: instead of all threads doing load-then-compute sequentially, specific warps take specific tasks and overlap them with software pipelining. Benchmarks use M=N=K=4096.

> **What this step changes — Scope**
> - Scope: one warpgroup walking load → MMA → writeback in order becomes three concurrent roles — TMA producer, MMA consumer, writeback — connected by full/empty barriers.
> - Layout: unchanged — same SMEM stages and TMEM accumulator as Step 6.
> - Dispatch: unchanged — TMA loads, `tcgen05` MMA.

**Topics.**

- Warp specialization: dedicating different warps/warpgroups to different tasks

- High-level barrier abstractions: `TMABar`, `TCGen05Bar`, `MBarrier`

- `PipelineState` for automatic stage/phase management

- `warpgroup_sync` barrier IDs for per-warpgroup synchronization

(The multi-stage SMEM pipeline and the persistent `ClusterPersistentScheduler2D` are reused unchanged from Steps 5–6; only the scope split is new here.)

### From Sequential to Concurrent

![Warp Specialization Timeline](../img/warp_specialization_timeline.png)

Read the figure as a contrast. In single-warpgroup Step 6, the one warp must finish the MMA before it can issue the next TMA load, so the TMA engine sits idle through the whole MMA and the Tensor Cores sit idle through the whole load. Specialization removes that turn-taking: the TMA producer prefetches data while the MMA consumer computes, and writeback runs independently — producer warp 3 issues the next load while consumer warp 0 is still running the current MMA, so neither engine waits on the other. Two barriers synchronize the handoff:

- **`tma2mma`** (TMA → MMA): signals that the loaded SMEM data is ready for MMA to consume.
- **`mma2tma`** (MMA → TMA): signals that MMA has finished reading a buffer, so TMA can reuse it for the next load.

With `PIPE_DEPTH=2`, there are two SMEM buffers (stage 0 and stage 1). TMA Load k=0 fills buffer 0, TMA Load k=1 fills buffer 1. When MMA Compute k=0 finishes reading buffer 0, it signals `mma2tma` — but the next load that needs buffer 0 is TMA Load k=2 (not k=1, which uses buffer 1). So the `mma2tma` arrow from MMA Compute k=0 points to TMA Load k=2.

### Warp Roles

With `WG_NUMBER=2`, the kernel uses two warpgroups (abbreviated WG in the role table):

| Actor | Location | Job |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **TMA Producer** | Warpgroup 1, warp 3 | Continuously loads A and B tiles via TMA |
| **MMA Consumer** | Warpgroup 1, warp 0 | Runs MMA as soon as data is ready |
| **Writeback** | Warpgroup 0 (all warps) | Reads TMEM results, writes to GMEM |

### 4 Barriers

The three actors are synchronized by four barriers (of three barrier types). The forward path (TMA → MMA → Writeback) signals data readiness; the backward path (Writeback → MMA → TMA) signals buffer release. Each barrier is named as `source2destination` — for example, `tma2mma` is the barrier where TMA signals MMA:

| Barrier | Type | Direction | Meaning |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| **tma2mma** | `TMABar` | TMA -> MMA | "SMEM data is ready" |
| **mma2tma** | `TCGen05Bar` | MMA -> TMA | "SMEM buffer can be reused" |
| **mma2ld** | `TCGen05Bar` | MMA -> Writeback | "TMEM results are ready" |
| **ld2mma** | `MBarrier` | Writeback -> MMA | "TMEM is free for next tile" |

Note the different barrier types: **TMA Loads** use `TMABar` (mbarrier with byte counting) — the TMA hardware automatically arrives on the barrier when the transfer completes, notifying consumers. **TMA Stores** use a completely different mechanism: `cp_async.bulk.commit_group()` + `wait_group(0)`. There is no mbarrier involved because stores don't need to notify other actors — the issuing thread just waits for completion. **MMA operations** use `TCGen05Bar` — the `tcgen05.commit()` instruction signals the barrier when MMA finishes.

The `arrive` calls in single-CTA Step 7 pass `cta_mask=0` (there is no other CTA to signal). Step 8 introduces clusters and uses a nonzero `cta_mask` to signal the cooperating CTAs.

### PipelineState

`PipelineState` manages stage indices and phase counters for a software-pipelined ring buffer:

```python
tma_ps = PipelineState(PIPE_DEPTH, phase=1)   # Producer starts ready (phase=1)
# tma_ps.stage = current stage index
# tma_ps.phase = current phase (0 or 1)
tma_ps.advance()                          # Advance to next stage
```

**The initial `phase` argument controls when the first `wait` passes:**
- `phase=1` (producer) -> first `wait(phase=1)` sees barrier phase 0 != 1, so it **passes immediately** (buffers start empty, producer can write)

- `phase=0` (consumer) -> first `wait(phase=0)` sees barrier phase 0 == 0, so it **blocks** (consumer waits for data)

Getting this wrong causes deadlock or data corruption.

### `warpgroup_sync` Barrier IDs

The GPU hardware has 16 named barriers (ID 0-15). `cta_sync()` uses barrier #0 by default. In warp-specialized kernels, different warpgroups run different code paths, so `cta_sync()` is not valid inside a single warpgroup branch: it requires all CTA threads to arrive. Instead, these kernels use `warpgroup_sync(10)`, which synchronizes only threads within the warpgroup. In multi-consumer kernels (Step 9), each warpgroup uses a different ID: `warpgroup_sync(wg_id + 10)`.

**Implementation.**

The Step 7 kernel uses `PIPE_DEPTH=2` for clarity. Higher-performance variants often increase the depth, subject to the SMEM budget. "Pipeline depth tuning" covers the trade-off.

To run any of these kernels, reuse the compile / run / check harness shown once in Step 1 ({ref}`chap_gemm_basics`): replace `hgemm_v1` with `hgemm_v7`, `hgemm_v8`, or `hgemm_v9` and pick a problem size (e.g. `M=N=K=4096`). The clustered steps need `M`, `N` to be multiples of their cluster tile — `256×256` for Step 8, `512×256` for Step 9 — so a tiny `128×128` size produces no tiles. Compile one step per fresh Python session (restart the kernel before switching steps), since the kernels reuse inner names and the compiler keeps per-session state. Per-step timings are summarized in *End-to-End Result* below.

### Epilogue (Writeback) Details

Step 7 keeps the epilogue simple: the writeback warpgroup reads the full `BLK_N=128` columns of TMEM into registers in one pass, then issues a single TMA store per tile. The sequence is:

1. Wait for MMA: `mma2ld.wait(phase)`. Steps 8 and 9 in this tutorial add a `fence.after_thread_sync()` here as a conservative extra — the MMA-completion mbarrier already covers the ordering, and most kernels (including CUTLASS) omit it, so Step 7 does too.
2. Read TMEM -> registers (128 fp32 per thread, warpgroup scope via `Tx.copy_async(reg_wg, tmem[:, :BLK_N])` followed by `T.ptx.tcgen05.wait.ld()`).
3. Signal MMA: `ld2mma.arrive(0, cta_id=0, pred=True)` (all 128 threads arrive) — TMEM is now free for the next tile. The two `arrive` kwargs recur in the clustered steps: `cta_id` names *which CTA's* copy of the barrier to signal (`0` = this CTA, the local barrier; in Step 8 the cooperative arrives target CTA-0 via `cta_mask` instead), and `pred` is a per-thread predicate gating whether this thread actually arrives (`True` here, so every writeback thread counts toward the arrival total).
4. Cast fp32 -> fp16 in registers.
5. Write registers -> Dsmem, then `fence.proxy_async("shared::cta") + warpgroup_sync(10)` to flush.
6. TMA store Dsmem -> GMEM via `cp_async.bulk.commit_group() + wait_group(0)`.

Step 8 (with `BLK_N=256`) and Step 9 (with `MMA_N=256` per consumer) revisit this epilogue and split the writeback into `EPI_N`-column chunks (`EPI_N=64`). The reason is register pressure: reading 256 fp32 per thread (256 * 4 = 1024 bytes, distributed across 128 threads and their registers) risks spills to local memory, and it also forces a larger Dsmem buffer. By chunking into 64-column groups, each iteration keeps only `EPI_N` fp32 registers live and issues a smaller TMA store.

**Implementation notes.**

- **Persistent kernel**: `bx = T.cta_id([SM_COUNT])` --- one CTA per SM, loops over tiles

- **L2-friendly scheduling**: `ClusterPersistentScheduler2D` orders tiles for cache locality

- This pattern --- warp specialization plus software pipelining --- is common in high-performance GEMM kernels, including CUTLASS-style designs.

### When Step 7 misbehaves

Warp specialization is where the GEMM path becomes easy to get wrong: TMA, MMA, and writeback now run concurrently, and a barrier mistake can deadlock, crash the CUDA context, or corrupt the output. The same failure modes resurface in Steps 8 and 9, so the debugging playbook lives in one place — see *Debugging Warp-Specialized Kernels* at the end of this chapter when something goes wrong.

**Pipeline depth tuning.** The Step 7 kernel uses `PIPE_DEPTH=2` (the minimum). Increasing it to 4 or 6 can let the TMA producer get further ahead of the MMA consumer, hiding more memory latency, but it consumes more SMEM. B200 has 228 KB SMEM per SM (see *Numbers to Keep in Mind* in {ref}`chap_background`). With `BLK_M=BLK_N=128, BLK_K=64, fp16`, each pipeline stage uses `(128*64 + 128*64) * 2 = 32 KB` for A+B, and the `Dsmem` writeback staging buffer consumes another 32 KB. `PIPE_DEPTH=4` uses about 160 KB; `PIPE_DEPTH=6` uses about 224 KB, close to the SMEM budget. Going deeper requires changing the writeback staging strategy.

---

With warp specialization in place, the next optimization is to have multiple CTAs cooperate on a larger tile.


(chap_cta_cluster)=
## Step 8: 2-CTA Cluster

Two CTAs cooperate via cross-CTA shared memory to form one 256x256 cluster tile. M=N=K=4096.

> **What this step changes — Scope + Layout + Dispatch**
> - Scope: the cooperating scope now spans two CTAs in a cluster, not one.
> - Layout: operand tiles are split across the two CTAs' SMEM; CTA 0 owns the shared completion barrier (`remote_view`).
> - Dispatch: the MMA gains `cta_group` / `cta_mask` so `tcgen05` runs as a 2-CTA cooperative op.

**Topics.**

- CTA clusters: multiple CTAs cooperating on a larger tile

- Cross-CTA SMEM access via `map_shared_rank`

- `cta_group=2` for cooperative MMA over a 256x256 cluster tile

- Cross-CTA barrier signaling with `cta_mask`


### Cluster Tile Shape

With `cta_group=2`, the MMA hardware can use operand tiles staged by both CTAs. Each CTA loads one 128-row slice of stored B, corresponding to 128 logical output columns after transposition, and the cooperative MMA sees both B slices:

![2-CTA Cluster](../img/cta_cluster.png)

**Why A and B are split across the cluster**: The tutorial stores GEMM as `D = A @ B.T`, where stored B has shape `N x K`. With 2 CTAs in a cluster:

- **A is split vertically**: CTA-0 holds A0 (rows 0-127), CTA-1 holds A1 (rows 128-255). Stacked: `[A0; A1]` (256 rows).
- **Stored B is split by rows**: CTA-0 loads B rows 0-127, CTA-1 loads B rows 128-255. Because the math uses `B.T`, those two stored row slices become two 128-column slices of the logical right-hand operand.
- With `cta_group=2`, the MMA hardware reads B from **both** CTAs' SMEM via cross-CTA shared memory access, so it sees the full logical output-column span.
- Result: the two CTAs cooperate on one 256x256 output tile. Each CTA writes a 128x256 row stripe of that tile.

Each CTA still loads 128×K of A and 128×K of B, so the cluster stages only ~2× a single CTA's operands — but it produces a 256×256 tile, ~4× the output FLOPs of a 128×128 tile. The MMA therefore does roughly twice the work per staged-operand byte: arithmetic intensity roughly doubles, because each CTA's B slice is reused by the other CTA's A slice through the cooperative MMA. That is why a still memory-leaning kernel speeds up (~1.8× in the End-to-End table).

### Tile Address Calculation

With 2-CTA clusters, the tile scheduler works in units of 256x256 cluster tiles. Each `(m_idx, n_idx)` from the scheduler identifies a 256x256 region, and the two CTAs within the cluster split the work. The address calculation for each CTA is:

```python
m_st = (m_idx * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_M
n_st = (n_idx * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_N
```

Both CTAs cooperate on the *same* 256x256 cluster tile; the single coordinate `cbx` (the CTA's position within the cluster, 0 or 1) picks this CTA's contribution along both axes. `m_st` selects the output row stripe owned by this CTA, and `n_st` selects the stored-B slice it contributes to the cooperative MMA; the writeback later stores both 128-column chunks of the 256-column output span. The scheduler's `num_m_tiles = M // 256` and `num_n_tiles = N // 256` count cluster tiles, not individual CTA tiles.

`cbx` appearing in both `m_st` and `n_st` is not a row/column-offset bug. On the writeback path `cbx` belongs to the M axis only: each CTA owns a distinct 128-row stripe (`m_st = (m_idx * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_M`, so CTA-0 writes rows `m_idx*256 .. +128`, CTA-1 the next 128 rows), but both CTAs write the *full* 256 output columns of the cluster tile. That is why the store uses `n_st_epi = n_idx * 256 + no * 128` for the output column — derived from the cluster's `n_idx`, independent of `cbx` — rather than the per-CTA `n_st`. `n_st` carries `cbx` only because each CTA loads a different stored-B row slice into the cooperative MMA; it is a load offset, not the CTA's output-column offset.

### Code Changes from Step 7

The code changes are localized, but each one corresponds to a new cluster contract:

```python
# 1. Cluster launch
cbx, cby = T.cta_id_in_cluster([CTA_GROUP, 1])   # cbx = CTA index within cluster (0 or 1)

# 2. Cooperative MMA (was cta_group=1)
Tx.gemm_async(..., cta_group=2)

# 3. Cross-CTA shared memory access
B_remote = T.ptx.map_shared_rank(Bsmem, cta_id=1)

# 4. Cross-CTA barrier
tma2mma_cta0 = T.decl_buffer(
    [CTA_GROUP], "uint64",
    data=T.ptx.map_shared_rank(tma2mma.ptr_to([0]), 0),
    scope="shared"
)

# 5. mma2tma / mma2ld arrives go from cta_mask=0 (single CTA, Step 7)
#    to cta_mask=3 (signal both CTAs in the cluster)
mma2tma.arrive(mma_ps.stage, cta_group=CTA_GROUP, cta_mask=3)
mma2ld.arrive(0, cta_group=CTA_GROUP, cta_mask=3)

# 6. Cluster sync replaces cta_sync at the end
T.cuda.cluster_sync()
```


### Cluster-Scope Changes

- **Cluster CTA ID**: `cbx` tells each CTA its position in the cluster (0 or 1). CTA-0 handles A rows 0-127, CTA-1 handles rows 128-255.

- **Remote barrier view**: In a cluster, each CTA has its own SMEM and barriers. To synchronize across CTAs, CTA-1 needs to access CTA-0's barrier. `map_shared_rank(tma2mma.ptr_to([0]), 0)` returns a pointer to CTA-0's barrier that is accessible from any CTA in the cluster. The TIRx wrapper is `tma2mma.remote_view(0)`. All barrier operations (arrive, wait) target CTA-0's barriers — this is the coordination point.

- **MMA dispatch from CTA-0 only**: With `cta_group=2`, CTA-0 issues one `tcgen05.mma`. The hardware drives a *single cooperative* MMA that spans both CTAs in the cluster — it reads operands from both SMs' SMEM and writes the accumulator across both SMs' TMEM. CTA-1 does not issue any MMA instruction. (Each SM still has only one `tcgen05` engine; "cta_group=2" is one cross-SM MMA, not two engines firing in parallel.) This is why the code guards MMA with `if cbx == 0:`.

- **Multicast arrive**: Similarly, `tcgen05.commit(..., cta_group=2, cta_mask=3)` is issued only by CTA-0 but signals both CTAs' barriers. `cta_mask=3` (binary `11`) means both CTA-0 and CTA-1 are targeted.

- **ld2mma init count**: `init(128 * CTA_GROUP)` --- both CTAs' writeback warpgroups (128 threads each) arrive.

**What changes for 2 CTAs.**

- `CTA_GROUP = 2`, `MMA_N = BLK_N * CTA_GROUP = 256`

- `ld2mma.init(128 * CTA_GROUP)` --- both CTAs' writeback WGs arrive

- TMA arrive byte count includes both CTAs: `CTA_GROUP * (BLK_M * BLK_K + BLK_N * BLK_K) * F16_SIZE`

- `tcgen05.alloc` and `tcgen05.dealloc` must use `cta_group=2`

- Writeback splits the 256 output columns into two 128-column chunks --- reading all 256 TMEM columns at once exceeds register capacity. Step 9 shrinks the chunk further to `EPI_N=64`

- `cluster_sync()` replaces `cta_sync()` at the end (ensures all CTAs are done before TMEM dealloc)

Step 8 brings us to **0.13 ms** at 4096³ (~538× over Step 1 in this benchmark). Step 9 adds a second MMA consumer so the pipeline can keep more Tensor Core work in flight.

If Step 8 is slower than Step 7, check: (1) TMA arrive byte count should be `CTA_GROUP * (BLK_M*BLK_K + BLK_N*BLK_K) * F16_SIZE`, (2) tile scheduler dimensions should be `num_m_tiles=M//256, num_n_tiles=N//256` for the 256x256 cluster tile, (3) writeback issues 2 TMA stores (one per 128-column chunk) — make sure each one completes before reusing Dsmem.

---

The cluster optimization improves operand reuse across the two CTAs. The final step pushes compute density further by adding a second MMA consumer within each CTA.


(chap_multi_consumer)=
## Step 9: Multi-Consumer Warp Specialization

The final optimization adds a second MMA consumer, doubling the compute density per CTA. The cluster output grows from 256x256 to 512x256. M=N=K=4096.

> **What this step changes — Scope + Layout**
> - Scope: one MMA consumer becomes two, selected by `warp_id`.
> - Layout: one staged B tile is reused by both consumers; A gains a consumer axis.
> - Dispatch: unchanged.

**Topics.**

- Multiple MMA warps (consumers) for higher throughput

- Multiple writeback warpgroups with independent barrier slots

- The structure used by the most optimized GEMM variant in this tutorial


### Multi-Consumer Structure

With `NUM_CONSUMER=2` and `WG_NUMBER=3`, there are three warpgroups (abbreviated WG in the role table):

| Warpgroup | Warp | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| **WG 2** | warp 0 | MMA consumer 0: `Asmem[..., 0] x B` -> TMEM cols `[0:256]` |
| **WG 2** | warp 1 | MMA consumer 1: `Asmem[..., 1] x B` -> TMEM cols `[256:512]` |
| **WG 2** | warp 3 | TMA producer: loads 2x A blocks + 1x B block per stage |
| **WG 0** | all | Writeback for consumer 0: reads TMEM `[0:256]` |
| **WG 1** | all | Writeback for consumer 1: reads TMEM `[256:512]` |

Each consumer multiplies its own A block against the *same* staged B tile, so one B load now feeds 2× the MMA work — B's load cost per useful FLOP is halved. A cannot be shared because the two consumers cover different M-row stripes; that is why sharing B, not A, is the right choice (Exercise 3).

### Changes from Step 8

- `Asmem = pool.alloc((PIPE_DEPTH, NUM_CONSUMER, BLK_M, BLK_K), ...)` --- 2 A blocks per stage, one per consumer

- TMA loads both `Asmem[stage, 0]` and `Asmem[stage, 1]`, with TMA arrive bytes now `CTA_GROUP * (NUM_CONSUMER * BLK_M * BLK_K + BLK_N * BLK_K) * F16_SIZE` (extra A block)

- MMA warp `warp_id` selects which A block and TMEM range

- `mma2tma.init(NUM_CONSUMER)` --- both consumers signal TMA per stage

- `mma2ld` and `ld2mma` have `depth=NUM_CONSUMER` --- each consumer uses its own barrier slot (`warp_id` for MMA side, `wg_id` for writeback side)

- Tile address: `m_st = (m_idx * NUM_CONSUMER * CTA_GROUP + cbx) * BLK_M` --- M direction has the extra `NUM_CONSUMER` factor because each cluster tile now spans `NUM_CONSUMER` consumers in M. Tile scheduler uses `num_m_tiles = M // 256 // NUM_CONSUMER` (cluster tile is 512x256)

- Writeback uses chunked `EPI_N` so each iteration keeps fewer TMEM-readback values live in registers

**Implementation notes.**

- In this Step 9 design, `mma2ld` and `ld2mma` are one shared object each with `depth=NUM_CONSUMER`, not separate per-consumer objects. Slot 0 connects MMA warp 0 to Warpgroup 0; Slot 1 connects MMA warp 1 to Warpgroup 1. MMA side uses `warp_id` as index, writeback side uses `wg_id`.

- This is the most optimized GEMM structure shown in the tutorial

## Debugging Warp-Specialized Kernels

Steps 7, 8 and 9 all share the same failure modes: TMA, MMA, and writeback run concurrently, and a barrier mistake can deadlock, crash the CUDA context, or corrupt the output. Keep this checklist close; these bugs repeat.

### Inspecting Generated Code

Generated CUDA source is the first debugging tool. For any compiled kernel:

```python
cuda_source = ex.mod.imports[0].inspect_source("cuda")
print(cuda_source)
```

The generated code maps TIRx constructs to CUDA like this:

| TIRx | Generated CUDA |
|------|---------------|
| `wg_id == 0` | `(warp_id_in_cta >> 2) == 0` |
| `wg_id == 1` | `(warp_id_in_cta >> 2) == 1` |
| `warp_id == 0` | `(warp_id_in_cta & 3) == 0` |
| `warp_id == 3` | `(warp_id_in_cta & 3) == 3` |
| `lane_id == 0` | `(((int)threadIdx.x) % 32) == 0` |
| `.init()` internal guard | `((int)threadIdx.x) < 1` (CTA thread 0 only) |
| `elect_sync()` | `tvm_builtin_elect_one_sync_op()` |

### Reference: Generated CUDA Skeleton

A correctly compiled Step 7 kernel has the following top-level skeleton. When debugging, run `inspect_source()` and check that your output matches this structure:

```c
// (1) Barrier inits  — top level, CTA thread 0 only
if (threadIdx.x < 1) {
  mbarrier_init(tma2mma[0..1], 1);
  mbarrier_init(mma2tma[0..1], 1);
  mbarrier_init(mma2ld, 1);
  mbarrier_init(ld2mma, 128);   // arrived by all 128 WG0 threads
}

// (2) TMEM alloc  — WG0 warp 0, all 32 lanes (no lane guard)
if (wg_id == 0 && warp_id == 0) tcgen05_alloc(..., 512);

// (3) Fences + cta_sync, then phase init: producer=1, consumer=0

// (4) Warp-specialized loop
if (wg_id == 1 && warp_id == 3 && elect_sync) { /* TMA  */ while(valid){ ... next_tile(); } }
if (wg_id == 1 && warp_id == 0 && elect_sync) { /* MMA  */ while(valid){ ... next_tile(); } }
if (wg_id == 0)                                { /* WB   */ while(valid){ ... next_tile(); } }

// (5) Cleanup  — warp 0, no lane guard
cta_sync();
if (warp_id == 0) { tcgen05_relinquish_alloc_permit(); tcgen05_dealloc(..., 512); }
```

Things to verify in your generated code:

- Barrier inits sit at **top level** (not inside a `wg_id` guard) — see *Deadlocks*.
- `tcgen05_alloc`/`dealloc` have a **warp guard but no lane guard** — all 32 lanes participate.
- TMA and MMA loops both iterate `K_TILES` times.
- Phase init: producer=`1`, consumer=`0`.

### Symptom Map

First diagnose by the *shape* of the failure:

| Symptom | Failure class | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel hangs ~30 s, then "unspecified launch failure" | Deadlock | *Deadlocks* |
| Crash within ms; subsequent `torch.randn` also fails | XID 43 / illegal memory access | *Crashes* |
| Output max-err in multiples of 128 (128 / 256 / 384 rows) | Sync race | *Wrong results* |
| Output `NaN` everywhere | MMA descriptor / TMA descriptor mismatch | *Wrong results* |

### Deadlocks

Most deadlocks are *one* of these — work through the list:

- **Arrival count ≠ init count.** Common case: `MBarrier.init(128)` but `arrive` is guarded by `if warp_id == 0: if lane_id == 0:` — only 1 thread arrives, the wait never returns. Reference:

  | Barrier | init(count) | Who arrives | Arrivals |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `TMABar` (tma→mma) | 1 | TMA engine via `arrive(stage, bytes)` | 1 |
  | `TCGen05Bar` (mma→tma, mma→ld) | 1 | MMA warp via `tcgen05.commit` | 1 |
  | `MBarrier` (ld→mma) | 128 | All WG0 threads via `arrive` | 128 |

- **Barrier init nested inside a `wg_id` guard.** `.init()` lowers to `if threadIdx.x < 1:` (i.e., thread 0 of the CTA, which lives in WG0). Nest it inside `if wg_id == 1:` and **no** thread satisfies both — barrier stays uninitialized. Inits must be at top level; `grep mbarrier_init` in `inspect_source()` to verify.

- **`cta_sync()` inside a warpgroup branch.** `cta_sync` is `__syncthreads()` — requires *all* CTA threads. Inside `if wg_id == 0:`, WG1 never reaches it. Use `T.cuda.warpgroup_sync(10)` instead.

- **`tile_scheduler.next_tile()` not called by all threads in the consumer warpgroup.** The scheduler tracks per-thread state; threads that skip it loop forever.

- **TMA and MMA disagree on K-tile count.** If MMA does `K_TILES - 1` instead of `K_TILES`, barrier phases drift and the second outer tile deadlocks.

- **`PipelineState` initial phase wrong.** Producer must start at `phase=1` (first wait passes); consumer at `phase=0` (first wait blocks). Same starting phase ⇒ instant deadlock.

### Crashes (XID 43 / illegal memory access)

These corrupt the CUDA context — subsequent `torch.randn` will also fail.

- **`pool.alloc` after `pool.commit()`.** Barrier wrappers call `alloc` internally. Correct order: `tmem_addr → barrier wrappers → move_base_to(1024) → Asmem / Bsmem / Dsmem → commit()`.
- **`tcgen05.alloc` / `dealloc` with a lane guard.** They require all 32 lanes of the warp to participate; `if lane_id == 0:` runs one thread and the hardware traps.
- **Missing `cta_sync()` before `tcgen05.dealloc`** — TMEM is freed while writeback is still reading.

### Wrong results

If you see mismatch counts that are exact multiples of 128 (128 / 256 / 384 rows), it's a sync race, not an arithmetic error.

- **`tcgen05.commit` outside `elect_sync`** — all 32 threads create commit groups; the 31 empty ones signal the mbarrier immediately. TMA overwrites SMEM before MMA reads it. Output is zeros or garbage.
- **Missing `fence.proxy_async("shared::cta")` before TMA store** — TMA engine doesn't see SMEM writes from threads.
- **Missing `cp_async.bulk.commit_group()` + `wait_group(0)` after TMA store** — next tile reuses Dsmem before the store drains.
- **Persistent kernel, intermittent fails at small sizes (e.g., 1024×1024)** — not GPU flakiness. Larger sizes mask the race with longer K-loops. Re-check phase reset between tiles and the TMA-store commit/wait.
- **`fence.after_thread_sync()` is usually not the cause.** The MMA-completion mbarrier already carries release→acquire semantics. Steps 8 and 9 here add it conservatively on the writeback edge (after `mma2ld.wait`, before the first `tcgen05.ld`), but it is not a general MMA-boundary fix. Do not add it routinely on the TMA→MMA edge; if your output is wrong, check the barrier and store-drain bullets first.


## End-to-End Result

Reference numbers on NVIDIA B200, M=N=K=4096, fp16, locked clocks, 1000-iteration timed benchmark:

| Step | Technique | Time | Speedup |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Sync load + MMA | 70 ms | 1× |
| 2 | K-loop accumulation | --- | Handle K larger than one tile |
| 3 | Spatial tiling | --- | Handle multiple M and N tiles |
| 4 | TMA async load | 0.50 ms | ~140× |
| 5 | Software pipeline | --- | Overlap load + compute |
| 6 | Persistent kernel | --- | L2 cache locality |
| 7 | Warp specialization | 0.23 ms | ~304× |
| 8 | 2-CTA cluster | 0.13 ms | ~538× |
| 9 | Multi-consumer | 0.12 ms | ~583× |
| --- | cuBLAS (reference) | 0.11 ms | ~636× |

All times in this table — including the 70 ms Step 1 baseline — are measured at the same M=N=K=4096 size, so the speedup chain is comparable. Steps 1–3 are introduced in {ref}`chap_gemm_basics` at small sizes (128×128 and 256³) to keep the first walkthroughs simple, but the 70 ms entry here is Step 1's sequential single-tile *algorithm* applied to the full 4096³ problem; the dashes (Steps 2, 3, 5, 6) mark steps shown for structure but not separately timed.

These numbers are one B200 reference run under controlled conditions. The `{.python .input}` benchmark cells embedded in each step are smoke benchmarks; use them for trend checking, not as peak-performance claims.

The 4 optimization techniques that deliver the biggest gains:

1. **TMA Async Data Movement** — hardware copy engine replaces software copy (~140× from Step 1 → Step 4).
2. **Software Pipelining + Warp Specialization** — overlap load and compute with dedicated roles (~2.2× from Step 4 → Step 7).
3. **CTA Clusters** — 2-SM cooperative MMA improves B-tile reuse across CTAs (~1.8× from Step 7 → Step 8 in this benchmark).
4. **Multi-Consumer** — two MMA warps for higher compute density (~8% from Step 8 → Step 9).

![GEMM Optimization Journey](../img/gemm_perf.png)

In this benchmark, the path moves from 70 ms to 0.12 ms, close to the cuBLAS reference time shown above.

The gains shrink down the list for a reason: the early steps remove *memory* bottlenecks — TMA replaces software copies, clusters raise arithmetic intensity — which is where most of the 70 ms lived. By Step 8 the kernel is already within ~18% of cuBLAS (0.13 vs 0.11 ms), close to *compute-bound*, so little memory stall is left to hide; Step 9's multi-consumer overlap recovers most of that remaining slack. The single-digit final gain is the expected shape near the compute ceiling, not a weak optimization.

The same machinery — TMA loads, `tcgen05` MMA, TMEM readback, and warp-specialized barriers — carries into a harder kernel next: Flash Attention adds online softmax between two MMA phases.


## Exercises

1. What happens if you set the initial `phase` to `0` for both the TMA and MMA `PipelineState` in Step 7? Draw the deadlock scenario.
2. With `cta_group=2` in Step 8, the TMA arrive byte count is `CTA_GROUP * (BLK_M*BLK_K + BLK_N*BLK_K) * F16_SIZE`. Why multiply by `CTA_GROUP` when each CTA loads its own data?
3. In Step 9, each consumer handles different M rows but the same B tile. Why is sharing B (not A) the right choice?

**Try with your agent**: Paste the Step 7 kernel and ask it to trace one K-tile through the four barriers (`tma2mma`, `mma2tma`, `mma2ld`, `ld2mma`). For each, ask who waits, who arrives, what tile becomes safe to read, and which buffer becomes reusable afterward.

# What Makes a Kernel Fast

Suppose you have written a kernel and it runs. Is it fast? The question is meaningless on its own:
fast compared to what? Before optimizing anything, you need a way to answer two more precise
questions — *how fast could this kernel possibly run on this GPU?* and *which resource is stopping
it from getting there?* The first sets a ceiling worth aiming for; the second tells you what to
fix. Almost every technique in this book — tiling, TMA, software pipelining, warp specialization —
is an answer to the second question for some specific kernel. This chapter installs the vocabulary
the rest of the book leans on to ask both: arithmetic intensity, the roofline, and overlap.

The numbers here are for the NVIDIA B200. Following the convention of {ref}`chap_background`,
we use order-of-magnitude ceilings: **on the order of 2 PFLOP/s** dense fp16/bf16 tensor-core
throughput and **on the order of 8 TB/s** of HBM3e bandwidth. The exact values depend on SKU
and clock, so treat them as round numbers for reasoning, not datasheet guarantees.

## The Roofline Model

Strip a kernel down and it does only two things: it moves bytes and it does math. Whichever of
those it cannot do fast enough is the bottleneck, and that simple observation is the whole idea
behind the *roofline* model — introduced by Williams, Waterman, and Patterson ("Roofline: An
Insightful Visual Performance Model for Multicore Architectures," *Communications of the ACM*,
2009) — which bounds attainable performance by the slower of the two:

$$\text{attainable FLOP/s} = \min\big(\underbrace{\text{peak FLOP/s}}_{\text{compute roof}},\ \underbrace{\text{bandwidth} \times \text{AI}}_{\text{memory roof}}\big)$$

where **arithmetic intensity (AI)** is the ratio of useful floating-point work to bytes moved
from memory:

$$\text{AI} = \frac{\text{FLOPs}}{\text{bytes moved}} \quad [\text{FLOP/byte}]$$

Plotting attainable performance against arithmetic intensity gives two ceilings — a sloped *memory roof*
(bandwidth × arithmetic intensity) and a flat *compute roof* (peak FLOP/s) — meeting at the **ridge point**:

![Roofline for the B200, with example workloads](../img/roofline.png)

The ridge point is the number that matters most, because it splits all kernels into two regimes.
For the B200 it sits at roughly `2000 / 8 ≈ 250` FLOP/byte. A kernel whose arithmetic intensity is
**below** the ridge can never reach peak compute no matter how good the code is — it is
*memory-bound*, and the only lever is moving fewer bytes (or moving them faster). A kernel
**above** the ridge is *compute-bound* — the bytes are essentially free, and the job is simply to
keep the tensor cores busy. Knowing which side a kernel falls on tells you, before you write a line
of code, which battle you are actually fighting.

## Arithmetic Intensity of Real Workloads

Which side of the ridge a kernel lands on is mostly decided by the algorithm, not the code — you
can often read it off the math before implementing anything. It helps to see where the workloads in
this book fall:

- **Elementwise and reductions** (GELU, RMSNorm) read and write large tensors but do only a few FLOPs per element. Their
  arithmetic intensity is well below 1 — deep in the memory-bound region. The best such a kernel can do is
  saturate HBM bandwidth, so the design goals are coalesced/TMA loads and fusion (do more math
  per byte loaded).

- **GEMM** has arithmetic intensity that grows with size. For a square `M=N=K` fp16 matmul, the ideal is

  $$\text{AI} = \frac{2N^3}{(3N^2)\cdot 2\,\text{bytes}} = \frac{N}{3}\ \text{FLOP/byte}.$$

  At `N = 4096` that is ≈ 1365 FLOP/byte — far to the right of the ridge. **GEMM at scale is
  compute-bound.** That is *good news*: the ceiling is the tensor-core peak, so the entire game
  is reaching that peak (use `tcgen05`, keep it fed, overlap everything). It is also why a
  naive GEMM is so disappointing — the problem allows peak, but a poor implementation leaves
  the tensor cores idle, sitting orders of magnitude below the roof.

- **Attention** sits in between and depends on sequence length and head dimension; Flash
  Attention ({ref}`chap_flash_attention`) is largely an exercise in *raising* arithmetic intensity by keeping
  intermediate tiles in TMEM/SMEM instead of streaming them through HBM.

## When Arithmetic Intensity Is Low

So suppose your kernel sits left of the ridge — it is memory-bound, and the Tensor Cores will idle
no matter how good the compute code is, because the bottleneck is bytes, not FLOPs. What do you do?
There are really only two responses, and they apply in order.

**First, try to raise arithmetic intensity — do more work per byte.** This is the higher-leverage move because it
can move the kernel across the ridge, turning a memory-bound problem into a compute-bound one.
Three techniques do it:

- *Fuse.* The biggest source of low arithmetic intensity is writing an intermediate to global memory and reading it
  straight back. Fusing the producer and consumer keeps that intermediate in registers or SMEM, so
  the bytes never hit HBM. Fusing an elementwise epilogue into a GEMM, or a normalization into the
  op that feeds it, removes whole HBM round trips. Flash Attention is the extreme case: it fuses
  $QK^\top$, softmax, and the $PV$ product so the large score matrix `S` is never written to HBM —
  that fusion is what moves attention rightward on the roofline.
- *Block for reuse.* Load a tile into SMEM or registers and use it for many operations before
  evicting it. Reuse is exactly what gives GEMM its high arithmetic intensity; any op with reuse benefits the same way.
- *Use a smaller dtype.* fp16/fp8/fp4 move fewer bytes per element, which directly raises arithmetic intensity (FLOPs
  per byte) and cuts the bandwidth the kernel needs.

**Second, if the arithmetic intensity is irreducible — accept the memory roof and saturate it.** Sometimes there is
simply no work to add: a pure copy, or a single-pass elementwise or reduction over a large tensor,
has no reuse to exploit, and its best possible performance *is* the memory roof. The job then is
not to beat the roof but to actually reach it, which comes down to a few mechanical concerns:

- Move each byte once — no redundant reads. Read shared inputs through L2, and when several CTAs need
  the same tile, multicast it once with a cluster/TMA load instead of each CTA re-reading it.
- Use wide, coalesced/vectorized loads and TMA bulk transfers so the memory system runs at full width.
- Keep enough memory requests in flight (async copies, sufficient occupancy) to hide latency and
  actually reach peak bandwidth.
- Drop precision where the algorithm tolerates it (store in fp8/fp4) to move fewer bytes.

The honest part: once a memory-bound kernel is at the memory roof, it is done — no compute trick
helps, and the only further gains come from changing the algorithm so it moves less data.

## The Optimization Ladder

The roofline tells us what is *possible*; it says nothing about how hard the gap is to close.
Theory says a 4096³ fp16 GEMM is compute-bound and could approach the ~2 PFLOP/s ceiling, but
saying so and reaching it are very different things. To make that gap concrete, here is what the
implementations in Part III actually measure on a B200 — the same algorithm, climbing toward the
roof one technique at a time.

The single biggest jump is the first one: switching from CUDA-core tiling to the **tensor-core +
TMA** path. At `M=N=K=2048`:

| Implementation | TFLOP/s | vs. naive |
|---|---:|---:|
| Naive tiled GEMM (no tensor core) | 2.9 | 1× |
| TMA load + `tcgen05` MMA | 330 | **116×** |

A single step buys two orders of magnitude — but it lands at 330 TFLOP/s, still far from the roof.
From there, asynchrony and scheduling do the rest of the work. At `M=N=K=4096`:

| Step | Technique | TFLOP/s | % of ~2 PFLOP/s peak |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| 5 | Software pipeline (depth 2) | 639 | ~32% |
| 6 | Persistent kernel + tile scheduler | 723 | ~36% |
| 7 | Warp specialization | 603 | ~30% |
| 8 | Deep pipeline | 1057 | ~53% |
| 9 | 2-CTA cluster | 1319 | ~66% |
| 10 | Multi-consumer | 1322 | ~66% |

Two lessons set up the rest of the book. First, **the ceiling is real**: the optimized kernel
reaches roughly two-thirds of the fp16 peak at 4096³ (and more at larger sizes), which is the
neighborhood of vendor libraries — the remaining gap is hardware reality, not missing tricks. Second, **the
steps are not all monotone** (warp specialization at step 7 momentarily *trades* throughput for
a structure that later steps exploit) — a reminder that an optimization is justified by what it
unlocks, not always by its immediate number.

## Overlap Is the Lever

What was that "rest of the work" the ladder relied on? On the compute-bound side, raw FLOP/s is
fixed by the tensor cores — you cannot make them multiply faster — so the only way to climb is to
stop *waiting*. A kernel that loads a tile, then computes on it, then stores the result spends most
of its time idle while one hardware unit waits for another. The fix is **overlap**: while the
tensor core works on tile `k`, the TMA engine is already fetching tile `k+1`, and the epilogue is
draining tile `k-1`, so no unit sits idle waiting on its neighbor.

This is why Blackwell exposes the load (TMA), compute (`tcgen05`), and store paths as
*independent asynchronous engines*, coordinated by mbarriers ({ref}`chap_async_barriers`).
Software pipelining (step 5) and warp specialization (step 7) are the two structural patterns
for arranging that overlap; Part III builds on both.

## Occupancy and Resource Pressure

Overlap is not the only way to hide latency, and it is worth knowing the classic alternative so you
understand why this book mostly sets it aside. That alternative is **occupancy** — how many
warps/warpgroups an SM keeps resident so it can hide latency by switching to a ready warp whenever
one stalls. Occupancy is capped by per-SM resources, namely registers and shared memory, and here
the modern kernels in this book make a deliberate trade: they spend a lot of SMEM (on multi-stage
tile buffers) and registers, so they often run at *low* occupancy and hide latency through explicit
async overlap instead of through many resident warps. Both mechanisms are worth keeping in mind —
classic occupancy-driven latency hiding, and the explicit pipelining this book focuses on — because
real kernels lean on whichever the resource budget allows.

## What This Buys You Later

With this vocabulary in hand, the rest of the book reads as a sequence of concrete answers to one
recurring question — "which roof am I under, and what moves me toward it?" The pattern repeats per
chapter:

- Memory-bound kernels → coalesced/TMA loads and fusion.
- Compute-bound GEMM (Part III) → tensor cores to raise the ceiling, then TMA + pipelining +
  specialization to reach it.
- Flash Attention (Part IV) → raise arithmetic intensity by keeping tiles on-chip, then apply the same overlap
  toolkit.

So whenever a kernel underperforms, the first move is not to guess at code changes but to return to
this chapter's question: compute the arithmetic intensity, find the roof, and optimize the resource
that is actually binding.

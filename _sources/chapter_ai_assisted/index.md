# Writing TIRx Kernels with Agents

:::{admonition} Overview
:class: overview

- Coding agents get TIRx wrong by default, so you must ground them in the real `tvm` / `tirx-kernels` source and a contract prompt.
- The chapter gives a workflow plus five concrete use cases (explain, review, debug, generate tests, inspect CUDA) and where agent review stops being trustworthy.
:::

**Motivation.** A coding agent is only as good as what it knows about your problem, and TIRx is exactly the kind of niche, fast-moving target a general model gets wrong by default. Ask one to write a Blackwell kernel cold and it will produce confident, plausible-looking code: intrinsics that do not exist, barrier patterns borrowed from Hopper, dispatch paths that never lower the way it claims. The model has read far more generic CUDA and Triton than TIRx, so that is what it falls back on. The payoff comes from closing that gap: ground the agent in the real `tvm` and `tirx-kernels` source and hand it a tight contract, and the same model becomes a fast, reliable partner for reading and changing Blackwell kernels. This chapter shows how to do that grounding, walks through five concrete use cases where it pays off, and marks the line where agent help stops being trustworthy.

Once the agent can read the right code, you talk to it in one of two ways. The first is delegation: give it a broad goal, such as "make the FA4 barrier section easier to understand," and let it choose the method. That is useful for mechanical edits after you already know the direction, but it teaches you less, because the important choices stay hidden inside the agent. The second is learning-oriented: turn the broad goal into a specific instruction, such as "explain `softmax_corr.full` and `softmax_corr.empty` as a mailbox-slot lifecycle, keep the value-MMA gate in a separate diagram, then rebuild the tutorial." For TIRx the second is usually the better investment, because the real work is not changing text or code — it is learning what choices are possible and which hardware contracts those choices imply.

You cannot write a specific instruction when you do not yet know what the right instruction is. In that case, make the agent do the discovery: ask it for candidates first. A good prompt is:

```text
I want to make the FA4 barrier section clearer, but I do not know the best form yet.
Give me 3 candidate rewrites. For each one, say what it explains well,
what it hides, and what code or diagram evidence I should verify.
Do not edit yet.
```

After reading the candidates, choose one and turn it into an explicit instruction. The point of the round-trip is that the next time you face the same kind of problem, you can write that instruction yourself. This is the value of using agents while learning TIRx: they help you discover what is possible and convert vague goals into reusable engineering moves.

To do that reliably, you need a unit of interaction that both you and the agent can be precise about. The previous chapters built up a way to read Blackwell kernels — identify the tile path, then check scope, layout, dispatch, and synchronization — and that same structure is the right way to move from a vague goal to a useful agent instruction. The unit is not a Python function or a whole CUDA file; it is a TIRx kernel contract. TIRx kernels are full of local contracts:

- which scope owns a tile operation,
- where each tile lives and how it is laid out,
- which dispatch path is requested,
- which barrier proves an async producer is complete,
- and whether the generated CUDA matches the intended hardware path.

Those contracts, plus the source references above, are the context an agent needs. With them in hand, the agent can help you draft, compare, and execute choices — but the programmer still owns the final contract. Keep that division of labor in mind for the rest of the chapter.

## Workflow

![Writing TIRx Kernels with Agents Workflow](../img/ai_assisted_tirx_workflow.png)

Those ideas combine into a loop:

1. Point the agent at `tvm` and `tirx-kernels`.
2. Start with the goal, but do not stop there.
3. If the path is unclear, ask for candidate strategies and tradeoffs.
4. Choose one strategy and rewrite it as a concrete TIRx instruction: tile path, roles, layouts, barriers, expected checks.
5. Ask the agent to execute, explain, or review one local contract at a time.
6. Confirm with generated CUDA, tests, and benchmarks.
7. Record the instruction pattern you learned so future prompts start more precise.

The agent is strongest when it helps you sharpen the instruction. Let it propose possibilities; do not let it silently decide the hardware contract.

## From Goal to Instruction

The loop above hinges on one step: turning a goal into an instruction sharp enough to act on. For tutorial writing, that progression looks like this:

```text
Broad goal:
Make the FA4 barrier section easier to understand.

Candidate prompt:
Give me three ways to explain softmax_corr.empty:
1. a full barrier DAG,
2. a mailbox slot lifecycle,
3. a wait/arrive table.
For each option, say which misunderstanding it prevents and which detail it hides.
Do not edit yet.

Final instruction after choosing:
Use the mailbox slot lifecycle. Explain that softmax_corr.full means
WG2 may read acc_scale or row_sum, while softmax_corr.empty means
softmax may reuse that SMEM slot. Keep p_o_rescale separate
because it gates value MMA, not the scale slot.
```

For kernel work, the same pattern applies:

```text
Broad goal:
Make this GEMM faster.

Candidate prompt:
List three possible next optimizations for this Step-4-style GEMM.
For each one, name the tile path change, the new barriers, the SMEM/TMEM cost,
and one generated-CUDA check. Do not edit yet.

Final instruction after choosing:
Implement PIPE_DEPTH=2 software pipelining. Add one SMEM stage dimension
to A/B, use one TMA barrier per stage, prefetch the first two stages,
then in the K loop wait current stage, run MMA, and prefetch the next tile
into the stage being released. Explain the phase flips before editing.
```

In both cases the broad goal is the same one you started with; what changed is that you now name the tile path, the barriers, and the checks. The pattern turns the agent into a learning tool: you are not only getting a patch, you are learning the vocabulary of possible patches.

## The TIRx Contract Prompt

Make that vocabulary explicit in the prompt itself. When asking an agent about a TIRx kernel, do not start with only a code dump; start with the kernel contract.

Each field has a job. The tile path gives the data flow. Then come the same three pillars as the per-step cards in the GEMM and Flash Attention chapters: **scope** (roles) says who executes each tile operation, **layout** says where its tiles live, and **dispatch** says which hardware path lowers it. **Barriers** say which producer-consumer edges make the async work safe to consume. The example below is the kind of prompt you can derive from the warp-specialized GEMM chapter.

```text
Target: NVIDIA Blackwell SM100a.
Kernel: multi-consumer warp-specialized GEMM (Step 9, {ref}`chap_gemm_advanced`).

Tile path:
GMEM -> SMEM by TMA.
SMEM -> TMEM by tcgen05 MMA.
TMEM -> RF -> SMEM -> GMEM by epilogue.

Scopes and roles:
WG2 warp 3: TMA producer.
WG2 warps 0-1: MMA consumers.
WG0-WG1: writeback.

Layouts:
SMEM A/B use tma_shared_layout(...).
TMEM accumulator uses TileLayout(S[(128, 512) : (1@TLane, 1@TCol)]).
RF readback uses TileLayout(S[(128, N) : (1@tid_in_wg, 1)]).

Dispatch:
TMA for GMEM<->SMEM loads and stores.
tcgen05 for the MMA; tcgen05.ld for the TMEM->RF readback.

Barriers (the names from {ref}`chap_gemm_advanced`):
tma2mma: TMA -> MMA (A/B SMEM stage loaded).
mma2tma: MMA -> TMA (SMEM stage free to refill).
mma2ld: MMA -> writeback (accumulator ready).
ld2mma: writeback -> MMA (accumulator slot free).

Symptom:
kernel hangs after the first output tile.

Question:
Which handoff should I inspect first?
```

This prompt gives the agent the same map a human reviewer would build before reading the code. Without it, the agent may guess from generic CUDA, Triton, or Hopper patterns and miss the Blackwell-specific issue.

## Case Study: Elected MMA Commit Bug

Consider a bug the contract catches and a raw code dump does not. The prompt sometimes needs a hardware fact, not just code. The broken loop comes from a warp-specialized GEMM. The MMA is issued by one elected thread, but the barrier arrive sits outside the elected-thread scope:

```python
for k in range(K_TILES):
    tma2mma.wait(mma_ps.stage, mma_ps.phase)
    if T.ptx.elect_sync():
        Tx.gemm_async(
            tmem[:, :BLK_N],
            Asmem[mma_ps.stage],
            Bsmem[mma_ps.stage],
            accum=(k != 0),
            dispatch="tcgen05",
            cta_group=1,
        )

    # Broken: this commits from every lane in the warp.
    mma2tma.arrive(mma_ps.stage, cta_group=1, cta_mask=0)
    mma_ps.advance()
```

In these TIRx wrappers, `TCGen05Bar.arrive()` lowers to `tcgen05.commit`, and the caller must guard it so only the intended issuer calls it. Only the elected thread has the real MMA work in its commit group. The other lanes create empty commit groups, and those empty groups can signal the mbarrier before the MMA finishes. The TMA producer may then overwrite SMEM while the MMA still needs it.

A useful agent prompt is not:

```text
Why is my GEMM wrong?
```

It is:

```text
The MMA issue uses elect_sync, but mma2tma.arrive is outside that elected scope.
In these TIRx wrappers, TCGen05Bar.arrive lowers to tcgen05.commit.
Can empty commit groups signal the barrier early?
```

The fix is to keep the arrive in the same elected-thread scope as the MMA issue:

```python
for k in range(K_TILES):
    tma2mma.wait(mma_ps.stage, mma_ps.phase)
    if T.ptx.elect_sync():
        Tx.gemm_async(
            tmem[:, :BLK_N],
            Asmem[mma_ps.stage],
            Bsmem[mma_ps.stage],
            accum=(k != 0),
            dispatch="tcgen05",
            cta_group=1,
        )
        mma2tma.arrive(mma_ps.stage, cta_group=1, cta_mask=0)
    mma_ps.advance()
```

This is the pattern for the rest of the chapter: state the contract, ask the agent to check one edge, then verify the answer against source, generated CUDA, and a runnable test. The next sections walk through the recurring jobs you will hand an agent — explaining, reviewing, debugging, testing, and reading generated code — each one an instance of that same pattern.

## Use Case 1: Explain a Kernel as Tile Primitives

Explanation is the most basic job, and the one that builds your own understanding fastest. Ask the agent to convert a code region into a tile-primitive table:

```text
Read this TIRx code and make a table with:
primitive, scope, source tile, destination tile, dispatch path,
barrier waited before the primitive, and barrier signaled after it.
```

For example, a good explanation of a GEMM writeback should look like:

| Primitive | Scope | Source | Destination | Handoff |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Tx.copy_async(Dreg_wg, tmem)` | warpgroup | TMEM accumulator | warpgroup RF tile | wait for MMA first, then `wait.ld()` |
| `Tx.cast(reg_f16, reg_f32)` + `Tx.copy(Dsmem, reg_f16)` | thread | per-thread registers | SMEM staging tile | fence before TMA store |
| `Tx.copy_async(D, Dsmem, dispatch="tma")` | selected TMA issuer | SMEM staging tile | GMEM output | commit the TMA store group and wait before SMEM reuse |

This is a better question than "explain this code" because it forces the answer to use the tutorial's mental model. If the agent cannot identify the scope, layout, dispatch, or handoff, that is a sign the explanation is incomplete.

For a line like `Tx.copy_async(Dreg_wg, tmem)`, a weak explanation is "this copies data." A useful explanation says: this runs under warpgroup scope, reads a TMEM accumulator tile, writes a warpgroup-distributed register view, lowers to four warp-collective `tcgen05.ld` instructions (each warp moves its own 32 TMEM lanes, covering all 128 lanes), and needs `wait.ld()` before the registers are consumed.

## Use Case 2: Review a Kernel Change

Explanation reads code that already works; review asks whether a change still honors the contract. It works best when the change has a small, checkable contract. Examples:

- change `PIPE_DEPTH` from 2 to 4,
- change `cta_group=1` to `cta_group=2`,
- add a second MMA consumer,
- replace synchronous copy with TMA,
- move writeback through SMEM and TMA store.

Ask for invariant checks, not a broad review:

```text
I changed a warp-specialized single-CTA GEMM into the clustered form from {ref}`chap_gemm_advanced` with CTA_GROUP=2.
Check only the cluster invariants:
- tcgen05.alloc / gemm_async / commit / dealloc cta_group values
- scheduler tile shape
- TMA byte count
- remote barrier view
- cluster_sync before cleanup
```

For warp-specialized GEMM, useful review questions are:

| Change | What to ask the agent to check |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Increase pipeline depth | barrier array depth, stage index, phase flip point, SMEM budget |
| Add TMA store | RF -> SMEM fence, warpgroup sync, commit group, store wait before SMEM reuse |
| Add CTA cluster | `cta_group`, remote barriers, cluster tile shape, cleanup sync |
| Add consumer | per-consumer barrier slots, TMEM ranges, scheduler M tile factor |

The agent is not deciding the design. It is checking whether the code still matches the design. For example, `cta_group=2` is not just one keyword on `Tx.gemm_async`; it also changes TMEM allocation, MMA issue, commit, deallocation, remote barriers, and scheduler tile shape.

## Use Case 3: Debug from Symptoms

Review assumes you know what changed; debugging starts from a failure and works backward. The discipline is the same — classify the symptom first, then ask the agent to map it back to the nearest producer-consumer handoff. The table here is the prompt-level version; use the *TIRx Language and Compile Pipeline* appendix page when you need generated-CUDA inspection.

| Symptom | Likely area | First checks |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Kernel hangs | missing arrive, wrong phase, wrong init count | barrier producer/consumer pair |
| Output all zeros | TMEM read before MMA completes, early empty commit | MMA commit guard, `mma2ld.wait` |
| Wrong rows in chunks of 128 | warpgroup handoff bug | TMEM readback, writeback barrier, per-consumer slot |
| Random garbage | SMEM reused too early | TMA/MMA empty barrier, TMA store drain |
| NaN everywhere | invalid input to math or wrong descriptor | softmax max subtraction, masks, SMEM layout, MMA descriptor |
| Works for small sizes only | scheduler or boundary bug | tile count, phase reset, tail guard |

The prompt should include both the symptom and the code around the relevant barrier. For example:

```text
Symptom: output is zeros or random garbage.
The MMA issue uses elect_sync, but mma2tma.arrive is outside that elected scope.
Does this allow an empty commit group to signal the barrier early?
```

This is the kind of question agents handle well: the local contract is explicit, and the agent only needs to check whether the code violates it.

## Use Case 4: Generate Reference Tests

Debugging needs something to debug against, which is where reference tests come in — and they happen to be one of the safest agent use cases. The rule is to let the agent write the reference, not the kernel. It does not need to understand Blackwell barriers to write a PyTorch or NumPy reference, but the prompt must still state the layout convention, or the reference will silently disagree with the kernel.

Good prompt:

```text
Generate a PyTorch reference for this TIRx kernel.
Operation: D = A @ B.T.
A shape: [M, K], fp16.
B shape: [N, K], fp16.
D shape: [M, N], fp16.
Use fp32 accumulation and cast to fp16.
Return max absolute error and relative error.
```

Expected reference shape:

```python
D_ref = (A.float() @ B.float().T).half()
abs_err = (D - D_ref).abs()
max_err = float(abs_err.max())
rel_err = float((abs_err / D_ref.abs().clamp_min(1e-3)).max())
```

For Flash Attention, ask for the exact tensor layout:

```text
Q, K, V are [batch, seq, heads, dim].
The kernel supports GQA: num_qo_heads may be larger than num_kv_heads.
Convert Q/K/V to [batch, heads, seq, dim] before calling scaled_dot_product_attention.
For GQA, repeat K/V along the head dimension after the transpose.
Transpose the output back to [batch, seq, num_qo_heads, dim].
If seq_len_q and seq_len_kv differ, verify causal-mask alignment explicitly.
```

The generated test still needs review, especially dtype, accumulation precision, head layout, and tolerance. But this is far less risky than asking the agent to write the kernel itself.

## Use Case 5: Inspect Generated CUDA

A reference tells you the math is wrong; it does not tell you whether the right threads ran the operation. For that, the generated CUDA is the ground truth. TIRx source expresses intent; generated CUDA shows the guards and instructions that will actually run. Agents can help read it if you ask a concrete question:

```text
Here is the generated CUDA guard around tcgen05_alloc.
Does it require all lanes of one warp, or only lane 0?
```

Useful patterns to check:

| TIRx intent | Generated-code clue |
|-------------|---------------------|
| warpgroup branch | `(warp_id_in_cta >> 2) == ...` |
| warp branch | `(warp_id_in_cta & 3) == ...` |
| lane 0 branch | `threadIdx.x % 32 == 0` |
| barrier init default leader | `threadIdx.x < 1` |
| elected issue | `tvm_builtin_elect_one_sync_op()` |

If the agent's explanation disagrees with the generated code, trust the generated code.

For a broader generated-CUDA workflow, use the *TIRx Language and Compile Pipeline* appendix page.

## Agent Review Boundaries

All five use cases share a precondition: the contract is already on the table for the agent to check. The risky cases are the opposite, where the agent has to invent the hardware contract instead of verifying it.

- Do not ask "fix the barriers." Ask "who arrives at this barrier, and how many arrivals does init expect?"
- Do not ask "add the right fence." Ask "which producer-consumer edge does this fence order?"
- Do not ask "is this phase right?" Ask "what happens on the first wait, and when does the phase flip?"
- Do not accept invented TIRx APIs. Verify unfamiliar names with the API reference or `rg`.
- Do not accept an `elect_sync()` explanation unless it says the election is one thread per warp.
- Do not accept performance advice without measurement. Pipeline depth, SMEM use, occupancy, and Tensor Core utilization must be profiled.

The boundary is not "agent versus human" in the abstract. It is whether the contract is already explicit. If the contract is explicit, the agent can check it. If the contract is missing, do not let the agent silently choose one. Ask for candidate contracts, compare their tradeoffs, then choose and state the contract yourself.

## Project Context File

Drawing the boundary once is not enough, because each new conversation starts an agent with no memory of the last. A project context file fixes that: it is a short bug log that you paste into future prompts, so the agent does not rediscover or contradict lessons you already learned.

Example:

```markdown
# TIRx Blackwell Bug Notes

### tcgen05.commit outside elected scope
Symptom: zeros or random garbage.
Cause: only the elected thread has a non-empty commit group; other lanes can signal early.
Fix: keep TCGen05Bar.arrive inside the same elect_sync scope as gemm_async.

### MBarrier.init from wrong warpgroup
Symptom: deadlock.
Cause: default leader is CTA thread 0. If init is inside wg_id == 1, no thread runs it.
Fix: initialize barriers at CTA level before role branches.

### TMA store reused Dsmem too early
Symptom: intermittent wrong rows.
Cause: the TMA store group was not committed or waited far enough before Dsmem reuse.
Fix: commit the store group and wait far enough for the staging SMEM buffer's reuse pattern.
```

Keep entries short: symptom, cause, fix. These notes are more useful to an agent than a long chat history.

## Exercises

1. Take the warp-specialized GEMM from {ref}`chap_gemm_advanced` and ask an agent to produce a tile-primitive table: primitive, scope, layout, dispatch, wait-before, signal-after. Which entries did it miss?
2. Move `mma2tma.arrive()` outside the elected MMA issue scope in a local experiment. Ask the agent to diagnose the failure using only the symptom, then ask again with the `tcgen05.commit` hardware constraint. Compare the answers.
3. Ask for a PyTorch reference for the Flash Attention kernel with GQA. Check whether the agent handles `repeat_interleave` for K/V heads correctly.
4. Give the agent the generated CUDA for a warp-specialized kernel and ask it to identify the TMA, MMA, and writeback branches. Verify against the source.

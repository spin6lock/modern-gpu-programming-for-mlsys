# Async Coordination: mbarriers

:::{admonition} Overview
:class: overview

- TMA and the Tensor Core are asynchronous, so issuing work is not the same as finishing it — consumers need an explicit completion signal.
- An mbarrier is that signal: producers arrive, consumers wait, and it tracks arrival counts and (for TMA) byte counts.
- Each barrier carries a *phase* that flips every round; waiting on the correct phase is what gates a consumer safely.
:::

**Motivation.** TMA ({ref}`chap_tma`) and the Tensor Core ({ref}`chap_tensor_cores`) are
*asynchronous*: issuing the work returns immediately, long before the work is done. That gap is the
whole point — it is what lets a load overlap with compute instead of stalling behind it — but it is
also where kernels go wrong. Read a tile before its load has landed and you get garbage; wait on the
wrong signal and the kernel deadlocks. Whenever one engine produces data another will consume — TMA
filling a tile the Tensor Core will read, or the Tensor Core writing a result the epilogue will read
— the consumer needs an explicit, trustworthy way to know the data has arrived. The **mbarrier**,
and the *phase* it carries, is how a kernel makes those handoffs safe and reuses them across pipeline
iterations: this chapter introduces the barrier itself, then phase tracking, then the handful of
synchronization rules a tensor-core kernel must obey ({ref}`chap_gemm_async`).

*Interactive: an mbarrier's counter + phase bit, and its init / arrive / wait APIs.*

An mbarrier is a hardware synchronization object stored in shared memory: a counter that knows when
it has reached zero. It combines an **arrival counter** with a **phase bit**. Its lifecycle is the
three operations a kernel performs on it:

1. **Init** — set the expected number of arrivals; the barrier starts at phase 0.
2. **Arrive** — each arrival decrements the counter. There are three ways to arrive:
   - **TMA tx-count arrival** — `mbarrier.arrive.expect_tx(bytes)` records the expected byte (tx)
     count (and counts as the issuing thread's arrival); the TMA engine then issues `complete-tx`
     as bytes land, and the barrier's phase flips only once BOTH the pending arrival count and the
     tx (byte) count are satisfied. It is not a second ordinary "arrival"
     (see {ref}`chap_tma`).
   - **`tcgen05` commit arrival** — the arrival requires an explicit
     `tcgen05.commit.mbarrier::arrive`; the commit group's completion drives the barrier arrival.
     It is not automatic without the commit.
   - **Thread arrive** — a thread arrives explicitly, e.g. to signal that a shared buffer is free
     to reuse.
3. **Wait** — a consumer blocks until the barrier reaches the expected phase for this iteration,
   which means all required arrivals have happened.

The first two arrival paths come from the asynchronous engines of the previous
chapters: the same hardware that runs ahead also reports back through the mbarrier. This gives the
producer/consumer pattern directly — the producer (say, TMA) arrives
when its data is ready, and the consumer waits before touching it.

## Phase Tracking

```
*Interactive: the phase bit flipping as a barrier is reused across pipeline iterations.*

The phase bit exists for reuse. A long
K-loop runs the same handoff hundreds of times, and allocating a fresh barrier for each iteration
would be wasteful and would not even fit in SMEM. The barrier is reused, and the phase bit
keeps successive reuses from being confused for one another. When all arrivals complete, the
barrier automatically **flips its phase** (0 → 1 → 0 → …), which lets a single barrier serve every
iteration of a pipelined loop: iteration 0 waits on phase 0, iteration 1 on phase 1, iteration 2 on
phase 0 again, and so on.

The consequence is that a pipelined kernel never allocates a barrier per iteration. It keeps a small
set of barriers and tracks, in a register, *which phase* the current stage expects. This
**stage + phase** bookkeeping is precisely how a software pipeline reuses a fixed pool of SMEM
buffers and barriers across a long K-loop ({ref}`chap_gemm_async`).

## Synchronization Rules

The whole model reduces to a single rule: **whenever one path produces data
and another consumes it, make the handoff explicit.** A tensor-core kernel only ever exhibits three
such handoffs:

- **Thread code → engine.** If threads write SMEM and a later MMA or TMA store reads it, insert a
  thread-level sync or fence first.
- **TMA → MMA.** If TMA fills a SMEM tile, the MMA must wait on the load's mbarrier before reading
  that tile.
- **MMA → epilogue.** If `tcgen05.mma` writes TMEM, the epilogue must wait for the MMA's completion
  barrier before reading the result.

The **TMA → MMA** handoff in motion — the TMA engine satisfies the barrier's tx (byte) count via
`complete-tx` as its bytes land, and the consumer's `try_wait` releases:

```
*Interactive: a TMA load signalling completion through an mbarrier. The `tcgen05` MMA → epilogue
handoff works the same way, with the Tensor Core arriving on the barrier instead of TMA.*

The same rule extends to resource reuse, which is a handoff running the other way:
before TMEM or a SMEM buffer is freed or overwritten, every participant that might still read it
must first have arrived. The GEMM chapters spell out the exact wait and fence at each of these
handoffs; those kernels resolve into a sequence of producer/consumer pairs.

# Async Coordination: mbarriers

By now a theme has emerged from the last two chapters: the Tensor Core
({ref}`chap_tensor_cores`) and TMA ({ref}`chap_tma`) are both *asynchronous*, and on both of them
issuing work is not the same as finishing it. That asynchrony is what buys overlap, but it also
creates a hazard. The moment one engine produces data that another will consume — TMA filling a
tile that the Tensor Core will read, or the Tensor Core writing a result the epilogue will read —
the consumer has no built-in way to know the data has actually arrived. Every such handoff must be
made explicit, or the kernel races. The primitive that makes those handoffs safe — and, crucially,
reusable across pipeline iterations — is the **mbarrier**.

*Interactive: an mbarrier's counter + phase bit, and its init / arrive / wait APIs.*

An mbarrier is a hardware synchronization object stored in shared memory, and at its core it is
nothing more than a counter that knows when it has reached zero. Concretely it combines an
**arrival counter** with a **phase bit**, and the way to understand it is to walk its lifecycle —
the three operations a kernel performs on it:

1. **Init** — set the expected number of arrivals; the barrier starts at phase 0.
2. **Arrive** — each arrival decrements the counter. There are three ways to arrive:
   - **TMA auto-arrive** — the hardware arrives once the expected byte count has landed (this is
     the `arrive.expect_tx` mechanism from {ref}`chap_tma`).
   - **`tcgen05` auto-arrive** — the hardware arrives once committed MMAs complete.
   - **Thread arrive** — a thread arrives explicitly, e.g. to signal that a shared buffer is free
     to reuse.
3. **Wait** — a consumer blocks until the barrier reaches the expected phase for this iteration,
   which means all required arrivals have happened.

Notice that the first two arrival paths come straight from the asynchronous engines of the previous
chapters: the same hardware that runs ahead also reports back through the mbarrier. With those
pieces in hand the producer/consumer pattern falls out directly — the producer (say, TMA) arrives
when its data is ready, and the consumer waits before touching it.

## Phase Tracking

```
*Interactive: the phase bit flipping as a barrier is reused across pipeline iterations.*

We have mentioned the phase bit twice without yet saying why it exists; the reason is reuse. A long
K-loop runs the same handoff hundreds of times, and allocating a fresh barrier for each iteration
would be wasteful and would not even fit in SMEM. So the barrier is reused, and the phase bit is
what keeps successive reuses from being confused for one another. When all arrivals complete, the
barrier automatically **flips its phase** (0 → 1 → 0 → …), which lets a single barrier serve every
iteration of a pipelined loop: iteration 0 waits on phase 0, iteration 1 on phase 1, iteration 2 on
phase 0 again, and so on.

The consequence is that a pipelined kernel never allocates a barrier per iteration. It keeps a small
set of barriers and tracks, in a register, *which phase* the current stage expects. This
**stage + phase** bookkeeping is precisely how a software pipeline reuses a fixed pool of SMEM
buffers and barriers across a long K-loop ({ref}`chap_gemm_async`).

## Synchronization Rules

For all the machinery, the whole model reduces to a single rule: **whenever one path produces data
and another consumes it, make the handoff explicit.** What makes this tractable in practice is that
a tensor-core kernel only ever exhibits three such handoffs, and once you can name them the kernel
stops looking like a wall of intrinsics. They are:

- **Thread code → engine.** If threads write SMEM and a later MMA or TMA store reads it, insert a
  thread-level sync or fence first.
- **TMA → MMA.** If TMA fills a SMEM tile, the MMA must wait on the load's mbarrier before reading
  that tile.
- **MMA → epilogue.** If `tcgen05.mma` writes TMEM, the epilogue must wait for the MMA's completion
  barrier before reading the result.

The **TMA → MMA** handoff in motion — the TMA engine arrives on the barrier when its bytes land,
and the consumer's `try_wait` releases:

</div>
```
*Interactive: a TMA load signalling completion through an mbarrier. The `tcgen05` MMA → epilogue
handoff works the same way, with the Tensor Core arriving on the barrier instead of TMA.*

The same rule extends naturally to resource reuse, which is just a handoff running the other way:
before TMEM or a SMEM buffer is freed or overwritten, every participant that might still read it
must first have arrived. The GEMM chapters spell out the exact wait and fence at each of these
handoffs, but the reading is easy once the patterns are familiar — those kernels resolve into a
sequence of producer/consumer pairs rather than the wall of intrinsics they first appear to be.

# Asynchronous Data Movement: TMA

GEMM and attention are compute-bound at scale ({ref}`chap_performance`), but only if the Tensor
Cores stay fed. The moment the cores stall waiting for data, that compute advantage evaporates, so
the real question is how to move tiles fast enough to keep them busy. The classic answer — have the
threads themselves loop over addresses and issue loads — spends the warp's instruction budget on
bookkeeping that has nothing to do with the math. The **Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA)** removes
that overhead: it is a hardware engine that copies rectangular tiles between global and shared
memory asynchronously, leaving the threads free for compute.

## One Thread Issues, Hardware Moves the Tile

What makes TMA different is the division of labor: a **single thread issues** a tile copy, and the
**hardware performs the transfer** in the background. There is no per-thread load/store loop. The
issuing thread hands the engine a descriptor — the tile shape, strides, and destination — and the
engine streams the bytes on its own.

This means the same logical "copy this tile" can be realized two very different ways. The threads
can cooperate, each pulling its share of the data, or one thread can fire off a TMA transfer and let
the engine do the rest. The two paths differ sharply in both performance and synchronization, and
choosing between them is a *dispatch* decision — the scope / layout / dispatch lens from the book's
introduction.

## Swizzled Layouts

Moving the tile quickly is only half the problem; it also has to land in a form the Tensor Core can
read efficiently. TMA can apply layout **swizzling** as it writes into shared memory, producing a
SMEM layout that the Tensor Core reads without bank conflicts. The swizzle pattern travels in the
TMA descriptor, and it must match the layout the MMA expects. This is the concrete link between
{ref}`chap_data_layout` and the hardware: the TMA descriptor, the SMEM tile, and the MMA must all
agree on the same swizzle, or the bytes the engine deposits will not be the bytes the core wants.

## Completion: Loads vs. Stores

Asynchrony is what buys the overlap, but it also raises a question the synchronous loop never had to
answer: since the issuing thread returns immediately, how does the kernel know the transfer actually
finished before something reads the data? TMA needs an explicit completion signal, and loads and
stores answer the question with different mechanisms.

![TMA load synchronization flow](../img/tma_sync_flow.png)

A **load (GMEM → SMEM)** integrates with an **mbarrier** ({ref}`chap_async_barriers`). The issuing
thread tells the barrier how many bytes to expect (`arrive.expect_tx(total_bytes)`); the hardware
arrives on the barrier once exactly that many bytes have landed; and consumers wait on the barrier
before touching the tile. A **store (SMEM → GMEM)** has no consumer waiting on the result, so it
uses a lighter-weight **commit-group / wait-group** mechanism instead: the kernel commits the issued
store group and later waits for it to drain before reusing the SMEM buffer.

Put together, TMA turns tile movement from a per-thread loop into an asynchronous hardware operation
with byte-count tracking and explicit completion. That is exactly the structure a pipelined kernel
needs: the load of the next tile can run in the background while the Tensor Cores chew through the
current one.

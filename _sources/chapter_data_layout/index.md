# Introduction to Data Layout

:::{admonition} Overview
:class: overview

- A *data layout* maps a tensor's logical indices to physical locations, and it decides coalescing, bank conflicts, and whether an engine can read a tile.
- The book writes layouts in one notation: `S[(shape) : (strides)]`, with named axes (`@laneid`, `@TLane`, …) and a replication term `R[...]` for broadcast or copied data.
- Swizzle is an XOR remapping of addresses that removes shared-memory bank conflicts.
:::

**Motivation.** The same numbers, written into memory in a different physical arrangement, can run
an order of magnitude apart on the same GPU. The reason is that a tensor's logical indices say
nothing about where its bytes actually sit, and the hardware is exquisitely sensitive to that
placement: it decides whether 32 lanes' loads coalesce into one transaction or scatter into 32,
whether their addresses land in distinct memory banks or collide and serialize, and even whether a
tile matches the byte arrangement a Tensor Core can read at all. The map from logical index to
physical location is the *data layout*, and choosing it well is much of what separates a fast kernel
from a slow one. This chapter builds the compact notation the rest of the book uses to talk about
layout — the shape–stride model, named axes that place data in lanes and registers, and swizzling
for conflict-free access.

In machine learning, we usually work with multi-dimensional tensors. A **data layout** specifies how
a tensor element with logical indices `(i, j, …)` is mapped to a physical location in memory,
registers, or other hardware storage. This chapter introduces the main data layouts that arise in
modern GPU programming. To reason about them clearly, we will develop a compact **notation** for
describing layouts across different machine learning system scenarios. We will also study
**swizzling**, a key mechanism for enabling efficient row-wise and column-wise memory access on
GPUs.

## The shape–stride model

We start from the simplest possible layout and build everything else on top of it. At its core a
layout is just two things: a **shape** and matching **strides**. We write it as
`S[(shape) : (strides)]`, and the address of a logical index is the dot product of the index with
the strides. A row-major 4×4 matrix, for instance, is

```text
S[(4, 4) : (4, 1)]        addr(i, j) = i·4 + j·1
```

This is the classic shape/stride model, written compactly (a row-major simplification of CuTe's
notation). Everything below is built from it.

You have almost certainly used this model already. If you have written
PyTorch or NumPy, then you have, because a tensor there *is* exactly a shape plus a stride over a
flat storage buffer:

```python
import torch
t = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
t.shape        # torch.Size([3, 4])
t.stride()     # (4, 1)        ← exactly S[(3, 4) : (4, 1)]
```

Seeing a tensor this way explains why many "reshaping" operations don't
touch the data at all. They just rewrite the strides and hand back a **view** over the same
storage. Transpose/permute is the clearest case:

```python
tt = t.permute(1, 0)               # or t.T
tt.shape                           # torch.Size([4, 3])
tt.stride()                        # (1, 4)        ← strides swapped, no data moved
tt.data_ptr() == t.data_ptr()      # True — same bytes
```

`t.permute(1, 0)` is `S[(4, 3) : (1, 4)]` over the *same* memory: the transpose is purely a stride
change. `reshape`/`view` on a contiguous tensor are the same story — new shape and strides, same
storage. (NumPy is identical; its `.strides` are just counted in bytes rather than elements.)

This is exactly how layouts work on a GPU, and the rest of the chapter generalizes one idea:
a tile's mapping — to memory, or via named axes to lanes and registers — is a stride
rule over a fixed buffer, so rearranging a tile is usually a change of *layout*, not a copy.
This zero-copy reasoning holds cleanly for a logical view over one linear address space; on a GPU it
applies only when the new view is compatible with the existing byte and ownership arrangement —
changing which thread or register owns an element, or changing the SMEM swizzle, generally requires
real data movement (loads, stores, shuffles, `ldmatrix`, transposes).

## Tile layout

So far, we have described layouts for whole tensors. GPU kernels, however, rarely operate on an
entire matrix at once. Instead, they work on smaller tiles that are loaded, transformed, and
computed on by different parts of the hardware. The good news is that tiling needs no new
machinery — it is still just a layout, now written with more dimensions. An 8×8 matrix cut into
2×4 tiles becomes a 4-D layout — `(tile_row, row_in_tile, tile_col, col_in_tile)` — with strides
chosen so each tile is contiguous:

```text
S[(4, 2, 2, 4) : (16, 4, 8, 1)]
```

A logical `(i, j)` maps through `(i//2, i%2, j//4, j%4)` and then the strides. Notice that the
notation expresses tiling without any special "tile" concept at all — it is still the same
shape–stride model, just with the index split into outer and inner coordinates.

The following interactive visualization shows how a logical matrix index is decomposed into tile
coordinates and then mapped to a physical address.

## Named axes

So far, we have treated an address as a location in linear memory. On a GPU, however, data can
live in more than one place. Besides memory, a tile may also be distributed across warp lanes,
thread registers, or TMEM lanes and columns. To describe these cases in a uniform way, we extend
the notation with **named axes**. A stride coefficient can now carry an axis tag that tells us
which space it moves through: `@m` for ordinary memory, `@laneid` for warp lanes, `@reg` for
registers, `@warpid` for warps, and `@TLane` / `@TCol` for TMEM coordinates. With this notation,
a layout can describe not only where data sits in memory, but also how it is distributed across
the hardware resources that operate on it.

With memory tags explicit, a row-major 8×16 tile in memory is just

```text
S[(8, 16) : (16@m, 1@m)]
```

The tags matter when a layout describes data *spread across threads* rather than laid out
in memory. For instance, `S[(8, 4, 2) : (4@laneid, 1@laneid, 1@reg)]` maps rows and columns onto
lane IDs and a per-lane register instead of linear memory — this is
the tensor-core register fragment you will meet in {ref}`chap_layout_generations`.

The following interactive visualization shows how a layout can distribute tensor elements across
warp lanes and per-lane registers, instead of placing them in linear memory.

```

## Distributed layout

Named axes are useful because they let us describe placement in a uniform way across many levels
of the system. Earlier, we used them for lanes and registers within a single GPU. The same idea
also extends across devices: axes such as `@gpuid_x` and `@gpuid_y` can describe where data lives
in a GPU mesh. In this way, the notation can represent sharding patterns that appear in
distributed training and inference. To represent data replication, we introduce the notation
`R[n : stride]`, where `R` indicates replication. For example, `R[2 : 1@gpuid_x]` describes
replication along the `@gpuid_x` axis. The following interactive demo shows different ways to
express sharding and replication on a 2×2 GPU mesh:

```text
S[(2, 4, 8) : (1@gpuid_y, 8@m, 1@m)] + R[2 : 1@gpuid_x]
```

```

### Intra-kernel replication pattern: scale factors in TMEM

The same dimension also describes something that
happens inside a single kernel: data the hardware *broadcasts across lanes*. Blackwell's
block-scaled MMA ({ref}`chap_layout_generations`) is one example. Its scale factors live in TMEM, and a 128-row scale
vector is stored in only **32 TMEM lanes** (logical row `r` → TMEM lane `r % 32`, with `r // 32` running
along columns). Those 32 stored TMEM lanes are then **replicated along the TMEM `TLane` axis**
(32 → 128 TMEM lanes) so that each of the reading warpgroup's four warps gets a copy in its own
32-lane TMEM window — a `warpx4` broadcast, written with a replication dimension. The reads
themselves are then performed by those warps' threads:

```text
S[(32, …) : (1@TLane, …)] + R[4 : 32@TLane]
```

Four replicas at a stride of 32 TMEM lanes: TMEM lanes `l`, `l+32`, `l+64`, `l+96` all hold the same
scale. The replication dimension carries no new data — it says "the same value, in four TMEM-lane
positions," exactly as `@gpuid_x` broadcast a row across the GPU mesh above.

```
*Interactive: hover a TMEM lane — it stores 4 logical M-rows (`m // 32` → column) and is broadcast `warpx4` across the `TLane` axis to all 128 TMEM lanes, one copy per warp's 32-lane window.*

The byte packing inside each column (the `scale_vec` 1X/2X/4X modes) and the `cta_group::2` split
are in {ref}`chap_layout_generations`.

For readers familiar with CuTe, you can view the notation in this chapter as a row-major variant
of CuTe, extended with explicit hardware-named axes and a designated replication structure.

## Swizzle layout

The last layout in this chapter solves a specific hardware problem. GPU memory is usually
organized into memory banks. Accesses are fastest when different lanes hit different banks. If
several lanes access different addresses in the same bank, the hardware serializes those accesses
into a **bank conflict**.

In tensor programs, however, memory is not accessed in a purely linear order. When working with
tensors and matrices, we often need to read both row slices and column slices of a tile. This
creates a central tension: a layout that is efficient for row-wise access may lead to bank
conflicts for column-wise access, while a layout that favors columns may hurt rows. **Swizzling**
is designed to address this problem.

**Swizzle** fixes it by permuting the address mapping — typically by XOR-ing the column index with
the row — so that *both* row and column accesses spread across banks. This conflict-free guarantee
holds for the matching element width, swizzle mode, and access pattern (the one an engine's
descriptor expects), not for arbitrary element widths or alignments:

```{raw} html
<iframe src="../demo/swizzle_8x8.html" title="8x8 XOR swizzle" loading="lazy"
        style="width:100%; min-width:1320px; height:640px; border:1px solid var(--pst-color-border, #d0d0d0); border-radius:6px;"></iframe>
```
*Interactive: an 8×8 tile, bank-conflicted by column in plain row-major, conflict-free after the XOR swizzle.*

The simple 8×8 example illustrates the core idea, but real GPU memories usually have more banks
than this toy picture suggests. To make swizzling work in practice, we do not treat the whole tile
as one monolithic object. Instead, we divide memory into small segments and apply the swizzle
pattern within each segment. In this way, the same row/column-remapping idea scales to the full
banked memory system.

In practice, different hardware modes define different choices of this basic segment, or **atom**.
Common examples are `SWIZZLE_NONE`, `SWIZZLE_32B`, `SWIZZLE_64B`, and `SWIZZLE_128B`, each of
which applies the same general idea at a different granularity:

```{raw} html
<iframe src="../demo/swizzle_128B.html" title="SWIZZLE_128B layout" loading="lazy"
        style="width:100%; min-width:1320px; height:640px; border:1px solid var(--pst-color-border, #d0d0d0); border-radius:6px;"></iframe>
```
*Interactive: the SWIZZLE_128B pattern.*

What the granularity refers to is the size of a small repeating **atom** on which the permutation is
defined: `SWIZZLE_128B` uses an 8 × 128 B atom, `SWIZZLE_64B` an 8 × 64 B atom, `SWIZZLE_32B` an
8 × 32 B atom, and the whole tile is then tiled by that atom. The demo shows the element arrangement
inside one atom for each format:

        style="width:100%; min-width:1320px; height:640px; border:1px solid var(--pst-color-border, #d0d0d0); border-radius:6px;"></iframe>
```
*Interactive: pick a swizzle format to see its atom shape (8 × N B) and how elements are permuted inside it.*

Swizzle is a remapping the hardware applies for you, so your job is not
to compute permuted addresses but to pick a consistent mode (e.g. `SWIZZLE_128B`) across all the
ops that touch a tile and let the hardware handle the addressing — `SWIZZLE_128B`, for example,
gives conflict-free access to 8 rows and 8 columns at a time in fp16. *Which* swizzle each engine
demands is generation-specific, and is the subject of the next chapter.
